Ready to Post: 

AI-Enhanced Syllabus Reflection: At the end of a course, instructors can have students revisit their syllabi to explore what they have done and the connections between the weeks and array of subtopics. The students annotate physical printouts of the syllabus with their reflections, memories, and questions. These annotations, different for each student, are then photographed and analyzed by AI vision tools to identify patterns, themes, and insights across the class. The LLM can order and hierarchize the connections it identifies, inductively reasoning to reveal those foci students found most salient, most difficult, most interconnected. This approach combines tangible engagement with the material syllabus with rapid AI-powered synthesis, producing an overall picture that allows for enhanced meta-reflection on the course's content and structure as a whole. It takes the students' notes and essentially enables a bird's-eye view, giving the students a chance to see — visually mapped out and categorized orderly — the most common and complex threads. Here AI is providing immediate and empirically grounded feedback that would otherwise exceed the temporal (and methodological) limitations of the course, which can be used to guide the final discussions about course's learning outcomes, its deepest components, and the students' experiences.

AI-Generated Content Analysis: Philosophy instructors can design assignments where students analyze and improve upon deliberately subpar AI-generated philosophical arguments. This approach teaches students to identify the differences between superficially correct writing and substantive philosophical reasoning. Students practice critical thinking by pinpointing logical fallacies, insufficient evidence, or oversimplified treatments of complex ideas in the AI-generated content, strengthening their ability to construct rigorous arguments. If desired, a second step may be taken: the students write new and improved paragraphs, and then feed those, along with the original, intentionally weak texts, into a custom GPT that they and their instructor have built, one that is designed to write sophisticatedly and reference specific sources. The GPT may be asked to analyze and compare both texts, to indicate the areas of most improvement, and to provide detailed feedback — all of which can also be used to enable deeper reflection on the material at hand. The second step effectively moves in an opposite different direction from the first; in the first, AI content is generated and then commented on by humans, in the second, human content is commented on by AI, and, if the process is repeated, a productive feedback loop is established. This exercise can help students iteratively refine their explanations, adjust their style and conceptual framing, and build out their argumentation. There are potential applications of this mechanic to proof-based mathematics, in which an advanced LLM would be tasked with generating flawed proofs, with varying degrees of error subtlety or concealment depending on the desired difficulty of the students' task.

Spatial Ranking Activities: Instructors from many disciplines can design interactive learning activities in which students physically position concept cards, objects, art supplies, or images printed out in real time along continua (such as a large graph or a meter stick marked from 0-100) to indicate their evaluation of different ideas and their relationships. Using the unique capacities of our space and materials, students place objects and annotations representing theories, historical events, or scientific concepts along scales and planes based on criteria like importance, chronology, causality, or ethical impact. The resulting arrangements are then photographed, and AI vision processing is used to quantify and visualize the collective results instantly. This approach combines spatial manipulation, student collaboration, and tactile and visual thinking with the analytical power of AI, allowing for macroscopic assessment of the created forms in order to augment discussion of patterns, outliers, and unexpected groupings, while also creating a permanent digital record of student thinking and experience that can be referenced throughout the course.






Ready for Review: 

Multimodal Translation Feedback: Language instructors can use AI to support translation activities by having students annotate physical copies of AI-generated translations. The instructor can photograph these annotated documents and use AI vision tools to quickly synthesize student feedback, identifying common corrections or questions. This approach preserves the cognitive benefits of handwritten work while using AI to efficiently process group feedback, allowing instructors to address patterns of misunderstanding in real-time.


Visual Annotation Analytics: Instructors can transform traditional text annotations into rich analytical data using AI vision tools. Students physically annotate printed materials (articles, images, charts) with highlighters, sticky notes, or handwritten comments, which instructors then photograph. These photos are processed through vision APIs (or through no-code options, like uploading images to a thread conversation or Custom GPT) that identify, categorize, and synthesize annotation patterns across the entire class. This approach preserves the cognitive benefits of physical annotation while providing instructors with immediate, comprehensive insights into student understanding, misconceptions, and interests—enabling responsive teaching that addresses the full spectrum of student engagement with course materials.

AI-Generated Content Analysis: Philosophy instructors can design assignments where students analyze and improve upon deliberately subpar AI-generated philosophical arguments. This approach teaches students to identify the difference between superficially correct writing and substantive philosophical reasoning. Students practice critical thinking by pinpointing logical fallacies, insufficient evidence, or oversimplified treatments of complex ideas in AI-generated content, strengthening their ability to construct rigorous arguments.
This is essentially the same exercise, but with a different direction (in terms of generation). In the first, AI content is generated and then commented on by humans, in this, human content is commented on by AI. AI as a way to interview/examine/force reflection on students: 

Simulated Audience Feedback: For assignments requiring students to explain complex philosophical concepts to specific audiences (like children), instructors can create custom GPTs that respond as members of that target audience. Students can iteratively refine their explanations based on this simulated feedback, learning to adapt their communication style and conceptual framing to effectively reach different audiences while ensuring philosophical accuracy.

This creative application requires deep understanding of the source material while teaching students about the interpretive choices involved in computational representations of literary knowledge.


AI-Assisted Close Reading: Instructors can design assignments where students first perform traditional close readings of texts, then compare their analyses with AI-generated interpretations. By identifying what the AI captures or misses, students develop more nuanced understanding of literary devices, cultural contexts, and interpretive frameworks. This comparative approach helps students articulate the uniquely human aspects of literary analysis while critically examining how computational systems process language and meaning.


Ideas from Moira Weigel Consultation
Narrative Combinatorics with AI: Literature instructors can design workshops where students experiment with narrative recombination using AI tools. Students identify key elements from studied texts (character types, plot structures, thematic motifs), then explore how these elements can be reconfigured through AI-assisted generation. By analyzing how different combinations create new meanings, students develop deeper understanding of narrative construction while critically examining how computational systems process and transform literary patterns and conventions.


Iterative Text-Image Generation: Instructors can create assignments modeling the iterative creative process using text-to-image AI tools like Stable Diffusion. Students begin with textual descriptions from literary works, generate corresponding images, then write new descriptions based on those images, creating a cycle of transformation between media forms. This process helps students understand how meaning shifts across modalities while developing skills in precise description, visual analysis, and creative interpretation.


Ideas from Instructor-facing Resources
Customized AI Learning Pathways: Instructors can develop differentiated learning pathways for students at various levels of AI literacy by creating repositories of scaffolded resources.

This exercise develops advanced language proficiency while teaching students to critically evaluate AI-generated content, an increasingly valuable skill as translation tools become integrated into academic and professional communication.


Ideas from Scientific Literature Analysis
Audience-Adaptive Science Communication: Science instructors can create assignments where students use AI to help translate complex research papers for different audiences (policymakers, high school students, general public). Students first analyze the original scientific content themselves, then prompt AI to generate different adaptations. By comparing and critiquing these adaptations, students develop skills in science communication while learning to use AI as a tool for reaching diverse audiences—a crucial skill for scientists seeking to make their research accessible and impactful.


AI-Assisted Meta-Analysis Projects: Research methods instructors can guide students in using AI to synthesize findings across multiple scientific papers. Students first select a research question, then use AI to help extract key methods, findings, and limitations from relevant studies. The AI assists in identifying patterns and contradictions across sources, but students maintain responsibility for critical evaluation and interpretation. This approach teaches research synthesis skills while demonstrating how AI can accelerate literature review processes without replacing human judgment.


Samples from Recent Humanities Courses
Mythical Creature Design Workshops: Art and literature instructors can design collaborative workshops where students create mythical creatures using AI-assisted image generation. Students first develop conceptual frameworks (habitat, powers, origins) through structured prompts, then use AI tools to generate visual elements they can combine with their own drawings in an "exquisite corpse" style. This approach democratizes visual creation, allowing students with varying artistic abilities to effectively communicate complex ideas while learning how AI can enhance rather than replace human creativity.


AI-Generated Spectrograms for Sound Analysis: Music and audio production instructors can implement AI-powered spectrogram visualization tools that display the frequency characteristics of student recordings in real-time. As students experiment with different recording techniques, microphone placements, or sound processing effects, they can immediately see how these changes manifest visually in the frequency domain. This multimodal approach helps students develop a deeper understanding of sound characteristics while making abstract acoustic concepts more tangible through visual representation.


Ideas from Cross-Disciplinary AI Integration
Policy Dilemma Simulations: Political science or ethics instructors can organize policy simulation exercises where student teams analyze AI-related social dilemmas in different national or cultural contexts.

Students interact with digital phylogenetic trees that visually demonstrate how DNA differences translate to evolutionary relationships, with AI providing personalized explanations and adaptive challenges based on student interactions. This approach makes complex biological concepts more accessible while helping students visualize abstract evolutionary processes through engaging, interactive learning experiences.


Ideas from AI for Language Learning
Tiered Text Generation for Language Classes: Language instructors can use AI to create differentiated reading materials that match students' varied proficiency levels. For a single topic or cultural concept, the AI can generate versions at multiple complexity levels, allowing all students to engage with the same content while reading at their appropriate level. This approach supports inclusive learning while enabling instructors to discuss complex cultural topics with the entire class, regardless of language proficiency differences.


AI-Assisted Material Development Workshops: Language departments can organize workshops where instructors collaboratively develop course materials using AI tools. Faculty work in groups to generate, adapt, and refine exercises, reading passages, and cultural context materials, with AI providing translations, suggesting adaptations for different proficiency levels, and checking cultural accuracy. This collaborative approach increases departmental efficiency while helping faculty develop skills in prompt engineering and critical evaluation of AI-generated educational content.


Ideas from Scientific Writing Enhancement
Audience Translation Exercises: Science communication instructors can design assignments where students practice translating complex research papers for different audiences using AI assistance. Students first analyze the original scientific content, then collaborate with AI to generate adaptations for policymakers, journalists, or general audiences. By comparing and revising these AI-generated translations, students develop crucial science communication skills while learning to use AI as a drafting partner rather than a replacement for their own expertise.


Abstract Drafting Workshops: Research methods instructors can implement workshops where students use specialized AI tools to help structure and refine scientific abstracts. Students input their research questions and key findings, then use AI to generate multiple abstract versions with different organizational structures. By analyzing these variations, students learn effective abstract writing conventions while developing critical evaluation skills to identify which AI suggestions maintain scientific accuracy and logical coherence.



Faculty-Led AI Education Initiatives in Development
Civil Discourse Enhancement Initiative
Building on our partnership with the Berkman Klein Center, we're developing specialized AI tools to enhance academic discourse quality across disciplinary boundaries. Our current prototypes include "assistance bots" that identify discussion stagnation points and offer contextual prompts to deepen engagement. Faculty testing these systems report that even subtle AI interventions—such as well-timed clarifying questions or suggestions to consider alternative perspectives—significantly improve discussion quality and inclusivity. These tools are being refined through iterative faculty workshops where instructors help customize intervention patterns for different course contexts. The initiative aims to simultaneously model constructive academic discourse while teaching students to recognize and implement these communication patterns themselves.
"Alligator Tank" Deliberation Framework
We're currently prototyping our structured AI deliberation system with faculty in philosophy, political science, and ethics courses. This framework uses specialized AI agents that demonstrate chain-of-thought reasoning on complex topics, making thinking processes visible to students. Faculty are using these demonstrations as analytical teaching tools, having students identify reasoning patterns, evaluate argument quality, and recognize perspective-taking strategies. Early classroom implementations show promising results in helping students understand that effective argumentation involves exploring diverse viewpoints rather than merely defending initial positions. The framework includes customizable deliberation templates and reflection prompts that faculty can adapt to discipline-specific controversies or case studies, creating a versatile teaching tool for developing nuanced reasoning skills.
Canvas Assessment Generation Exploration
Several faculty members have approached us with ideas for streamlining their assessment creation process using AI tools.

Instructors are particularly interested in identifying content coverage gaps and ensuring appropriate difficulty progression. While still in early development, the faculty working group is defining metrics for what constitutes appropriate assessment complexity relative to lecture material and practice problems. This faculty-driven initiative reflects growing interest in using AI to strengthen pedagogical alignment rather than simply reducing workload.
Student Background Analysis Prototype
Faculty teaching interdisciplinary courses have expressed interest in better understanding the diverse academic backgrounds their students bring to class. We're supporting development of analytical approaches that would help instructors gain insights into students' previous coursework and co-enrollments. Several professors are testing manual versions of this approach, finding value in understanding what percentage of their students have taken specific prerequisites or related courses. As development continues, we're working with these faculty members to determine the most helpful data visualizations and insights while ensuring appropriate privacy considerations and institutional data access protocols.
Classroom Response Pattern Recognition
Faculty teaching large lecture courses are exploring how AI might help them better understand patterns in student questions and comments during class sessions. Their vision includes systems that could identify recurring themes in student responses, highlight novel insights, or flag widespread confusions. Several instructors are manually testing this approach by having teaching assistants categorize and summarize student contributions in real-time, with promising results for making large classes more responsive to student needs. Faculty are particularly interested in how such tools might help them adjust teaching on the fly without attempting to process dozens of individual responses simultaneously.
Assessment Calibration Support
A working group of faculty has been exploring ways to better calibrate assessment difficulty throughout their courses. Their ideas involve comparing proposed exam questions against previously used homework assignments and lecture content to identify potential difficulty misalignments. Faculty have noted that students often struggle when assessment complexity doesn't match practice opportunities, and they're interested in more systematic approaches to identifying these disparities. While still conceptual, this initiative reflects growing faculty interest in using AI to support more intentionally structured learning experiences rather than simply for content creation.
Student Progress Monitoring Tools
Several academic departments have expressed interest in more proactive approaches to identifying students who may need additional support. Faculty are exploring how regular analysis of grade sheets might help identify concerning patterns—such as missing assignments or declining performance—earlier in the term. Instructors have been manually implementing versions of this approach, finding value in weekly grade reviews that highlight potential concerns. As development continues, faculty are defining appropriate intervention thresholds and considering how such tools might suggest targeted support resources based on specific performance patterns.
Course-Specific AI Tutoring
Faculty across disciplines are experimenting with AI tutoring systems that are specifically grounded in their course materials rather than generic knowledge. These instructors envision AI assistants that draw upon designated course content to provide consistent, accurate responses to student questions outside of office hours. Early explorations involve faculty creating prompt libraries that help chatbots respond in ways aligned with their teaching approach. Instructors are particularly interested in analytics about frequently asked questions, which might reveal topics that need additional explanation in class or revised treatment in course materials.
Slide Enhancement Collaboration
A group of faculty is exploring how AI might help expand and enhance their lecture materials in response to student needs.

Some of these assignments and activities turn the mirror on AI itself, asking students to compare the results of more traditional scholarly methods to those produced by AI in order to help them become more discerning as to what AI can/can't (or should/shouldn't) be asked to do. Others use AI more straightforwardly as a tool to achieve other learning objectives (e.g. to allow students with little or no experience with data analysis to make sense of authentic datasets).
Here are step-by-step instructions for a handful of ways in which you could use AI to promote student learning. While these instructions were written in 2023 for use with Harvard's AI Sandbox, they should work nearly identically in the OpenAI Edu license:
How students can deepen their own understanding of a concept
How students can quiz themselves to gauge understanding / prepare for a class discussion
How students can practice a language they are learning
Scaffold students into understanding figures in scientific papers
Help students study a translated text
Help students learn data analysis in R
