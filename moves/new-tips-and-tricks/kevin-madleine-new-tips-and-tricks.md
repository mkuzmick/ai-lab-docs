# New AI Tips and Tricks from Kevin and Madeleine

### Multimodal Translation Feedback  
Language instructors can use AI to support translation activities by having students annotate physical copies of AI-generated translations. The instructor can photograph these annotated documents and use AI vision tools to synthesize student notes and highlights quickly, identifying common corrections or questions. This approach preserves the benefits of handwritten work while using AI to process an entire group's feedback efficiently, allowing instructors to address areas of focus and patterns of misunderstanding in real-time.

### Visual Annotation Analytics  
Instructors can transform traditional text and image commentary into rich analytical data using AI vision tools. Students physically annotate printed materials (articles, maps, photographs, charts) with highlighters, sticky notes, or handwritten comments, which instructors then photograph. These photos are processed through vision APIs (or through no-code options, like uploading images to a conversation thread or to a Custom GPT) that identify, categorize, and synthesize annotation patterns across the entire class. This approach preserves the value of real-time brainstorming while providing instructors and students with immediate, comprehensive insights into student interests, understanding, misconceptions, and questions.

### Voice-Cloned Discussion Facilitators  
Instructors can create AI voice clones to serve as additional discussion participants or guides. These voice bots could represent different perspectives, historical figures relevant to course content, or even the instructor themselves, allowing students to engage in dialogue with the AI-generated subject positions to develop and articulate their ideas before collaborative activities. This adds a novel dimension to class discussions while maintaining the crucial human element of peer collaboration.

### AI-Assisted Language Practice  
Language instructors can use AI voice tools and custom chatbots that allow students to develop their speaking and listening skills through natural conversations. Students speak with these AI systems through microphones, and the AI interlocutor can be designed simply to converse dialogically or to provide immediate feedback (on pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary usage) or both. This provides additional practice opportunities outside of class time and helps students build confidence before speaking with peers or the instructor.

### AI-Assisted Peer Review Simulation  
Instructors can create custom GPTs trained on discipline-specific writing standards to simulate the peer review process for student writing. Students submit drafts to these AI reviewers, which provide structured feedback in two, three, or more voices, similar to revise and resubmit instructions they might encounter in the process of professional scientific publishing. This helps students internalize field-specific writing expectations while providing more revision opportunities and perspectives than traditional peer review alone might support.

### Interactive AI-Augmented Maps  
History instructors can create dynamic learning experiences using AI-generated maps and graphics projected onto large surfaces with which students can physically interact. For geographic content, AI can generate contextual information about regions as students annotate and discuss them. This approach combines the benefits of the richness of digital information with physical, collaborative engagement, allowing students to build knowledge of historical geographies—together as a group—through direct interaction with deeper data that is organized visually and spatially.

### Real-Time Response Analysis  
For large lecture courses, instructors can implement AI tools that analyze weekly student posts, responses to discussion prompts, or quick writes in real-time. Rather than sampling just a few student contributions, the AI can identify patterns, misconceptions, and insightful perspectives across every submission, allowing the instructor to address the full spectrum of student thinking during the same class session and to focus on the most relevant or common issues. This approach can also make large classes feel more interactive and participatory while further ensuring that diverse student perspectives are captured and addressed.

### Policy Dilemma Simulations  
Political science or ethics instructors can organize policy simulation exercises where student teams analyze social dilemmas in different national or cultural contexts. Students create custom GPTs representing the perspectives of the separate, relevant groups and then prompt those discussants into a debate. In addition to revealing the salient issues and beliefs at stake, this can help students generate potential policy frameworks and then draft persuasive presentations advocating for their proposed solutions. This approach teaches students to evaluate the societal impacts of conflicting views or ideologies while also enhancing their skills in policy analysis, comparative research, and effective communication.

### Draft a Rubric  
An instructor can upload an assignment prompt into an AI chat to generate a first draft of an assessment rubric. The AI can then be asked to identify both explicit and implicit criteria embedded in the assignment prompt, ensuring the rubric is comprehensive. Depending on the result, the AI can be used to refine the draft to align more completely with the overall course objectives and desired grading standards.

### Norm Grades Across Sections  
Ensuring consistent grading across large courses with multiple teaching fellows or instructors can be challenging. Harvard-supported AI tools can assist in analyzing uploaded course rubrics and answer keys alongside examples of graded student work. The AI can be prompted to compare submissions against the rubric and to identify discrepancies or inconsistencies in grading across sections. It can then flag student work that deviates significantly from the norm for further (human) review.

### Slide Feedback Loop
Faculty who teach with slides can upload their decks to an AI tool that evaluates clarity, pacing, and alignment with learning objectives. The AI can suggest where to add interactivity, simplify visuals, or trim redundant content—helping instructors design more effective presentations and avoid cognitive overload.

### Group Work Synthesizer
After in-class group work or collaborative activities, instructors can ask each group to submit a photo of their whiteboard, worksheet, or notes. AI vision tools can analyze and synthesize common ideas or divergent responses across groups. Instructors can project these AI summaries to guide follow-up discussion, without needing to manually scan every submission.
