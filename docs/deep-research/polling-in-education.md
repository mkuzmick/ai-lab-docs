# Polling Use Cases in College-Level Courses

Classroom polling is an evidence-based teaching practice that actively engages students in their own learning ([What Works: Classroom Polling Ideas to Engage Students | Center for Teaching Innovation](https://teaching.cornell.edu/classroom-polling-ideas#:~:text=Classroom%20polling%20is%20an%20evidence,peers%2C%20and%20generate%20new%20ideas)). Instructors across disciplines use polls to pose questions that spur predictions, stimulate discussion, check for understanding, and gather feedback in real time ([What Works: Classroom Polling Ideas to Engage Students | Center for Teaching Innovation](https://teaching.cornell.edu/classroom-polling-ideas#:~:text=Classroom%20polling%20is%20an%20evidence,peers%2C%20and%20generate%20new%20ideas)). Research has found that polling can make class more interactive and enjoyable, prompting students to think critically, while also giving instructors immediate insight into student comprehension ([Using Polls for Student Engagement](https://teachingandlearning.knowledgeowl.com/docs/using-polls-for-student-engagement#:~:text=%3E%20%3E%20,to%20adjust%20our%20teaching%20accordingly)). Polls are typically anonymous, which encourages participation from students who might not speak up otherwise – especially on sensitive or controversial topics ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=In%20many%20fields%2C%20instructors%20want,used%20to%20engage%20in%20a)). Modern polling tools allow students to respond using personal devices (phones, laptops, etc.) both **synchronously** during class and **asynchronously** outside of class. In fact, many platforms (e.g. Poll Everywhere, Mentimeter) support leaving a question active for later responses or integration via LMS, so that even students outside a live session can contribute ([Using Polls for Student Engagement](https://teachingandlearning.knowledgeowl.com/docs/using-polls-for-student-engagement#:~:text=Classroom%20teach)) ([Using Polls for Student Engagement](https://teachingandlearning.knowledgeowl.com/docs/using-polls-for-student-engagement#:~:text=Poll%20Everywhere%20is%20for%20synchronous,for%20asynchronous%20students%20to%20answer)). Below, we explore extensive polling use cases in **Humanities**, **Social Sciences**, and **Sciences**, with discipline-specific examples. Each use case includes a sample poll question, an explanation of how it supports student learning (from formative assessment and engagement to metacognition), and notes on relevant tools (e.g. Poll Everywhere, Google Forms, collaborative documents) that could facilitate the scenario.

## Humanities

Humanities courses often deal with interpretation, critical analysis, and diverse perspectives. Polling can give every student a voice and provoke reflection in seminars, literature discussions, philosophy debates, art critiques, and more. It turns passive listening into active engagement as students must formulate opinions or recall information. The following use cases show how polling can enrich humanities classes, from literature and art history to philosophy and languages.

### Literary Interpretation Check (In-Class Concept Poll)  
*Example Poll:* In an English literature class after reading a short story, the instructor asks: **“Which theme is most prominent in this story?”** Options might include major themes (e.g. *Love*, *Isolation*, *Coming of Age*, *Morality*). Students vote on the theme they believe is most central.  

**How it supports learning:** This poll requires students to distill their interpretation of the story’s meaning and commit to an answer. It functions as a quick **concept check** on interpretive skills – do students grasp the story’s themes? The distribution of answers reveals the class’s range of interpretations, which can launch a discussion about why different themes resonated. If one option is clearly favored, the instructor can confirm that understanding; if responses are split, students can be invited to explain their reasoning for each choice, fostering deeper **close reading** and critical thinking. Polling interpretations in this way engages every student, not just the outspoken, and highlights that literary analysis can have multiple valid viewpoints. It also lets quieter students contribute insights anonymously, building confidence for subsequent open discussion ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=In%20many%20fields%2C%20instructors%20want,used%20to%20engage%20in%20a)). This formative feedback helps the instructor identify misconceptions (e.g. if a significant theme was overlooked by most students) and address them immediately.  

**Tools:** Live polling tools like **Poll Everywhere** or **Mentimeter** work well here. The instructor can display a multiple-choice poll within slides and show the bar chart of responses updating in real time. For asynchronous use, an instructor might post the poll question in a forum or **Google Forms** before class – students submit their interpretation individually, and the teacher can start the next class by showing a summary of responses. Both approaches ensure students engage with the reading’s themes before the instructor expounds on them.

### Audience Reaction Word Cloud (Open-Ended Poll)  
*Example Poll:* In a film studies or art history course, after students watch a powerful documentary or examine a painting, the instructor invites them to **“Share one word about how you feel right now.”** Students submit single-word responses describing their reaction (e.g. *inspired*, *shocked*, *frustrated*, *hopeful*).  

 ([8 Word Cloud Examples Created with a Live Audience](https://blog.polleverywhere.com/live-word-cloud-examples)) *A live word cloud of student responses after a documentary screening. The most frequent words (e.g. “inspired,” “emotional,” “determined”) appear larger, instantly visualizing the classroom’s shared feelings.*  

**How it supports learning:** This use of polling captures the *affective* and subjective side of humanities content, giving students a moment to reflect on their emotional or personal response to a work. By generating a **word cloud** from the class’s input, the instructor can visually highlight common sentiments and outliers. This encourages metacognition – students see how their reaction compares to peers’, which can be validating (“I’m not the only one who felt shocked”) and prompts them to consider *why* certain responses (like *“inspired”* or *“frustrated”*) dominated. Discussing the word cloud can lead to a rich conversation about the artwork’s impact and different interpretations. Because the poll is anonymous, students tend to respond honestly about personal reactions ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=In%20many%20fields%2C%20instructors%20want,used%20to%20engage%20in%20a)). This strategy builds community as well – in a seminar, recognizing shared emotional reactions can create a sense of camaraderie or collective experience. It also transitions nicely into analytical discussion: for instance, if many answered “confused,” the instructor knows to address points of confusion in the film or artwork. If words like “empowered” or “outraged” appear, students can be prompted to explore what in the piece elicited those feelings. In essence, the poll serves as an **ice-breaker** and a reflective exercise, ensuring that every student has input into the interpretation of the piece’s impact.  

**Tools:** Polling platforms such as **Poll Everywhere** and **Mentimeter** support open-ended responses and can generate word clouds automatically. The instructor activates the activity and students respond via a link or SMS. The word cloud updates live on the screen. This can be done synchronously (e.g. immediately after the viewing) or asynchronously (for example, students watch a film at home and submit their one-word reaction via a Poll Everywhere link before an online discussion). In low-tech situations, a similar exercise could be done via a shared **Google Doc** or Jamboard, where students each write a word – though the real-time word cloud visualization offered by polling tools is more impactful.

### Philosophical Opinion Poll (Ethics & Debate)  
*Example Poll:* In a philosophy class studying ethics, the instructor poses a dilemma: **“Is it ever morally acceptable to lie?”** and provides choices: **Always Acceptable**, **Sometimes/Depends**, **Never Acceptable**. Students vote on the option that aligns with their personal belief. Alternatively, the poll could ask which philosopher’s stance they agree with most in a given scenario (e.g. **Kantian (duty-based)** vs. **Utilitarian (outcome-based)**).  

**How it supports learning:** This use case elicits students’ **personal beliefs or perspectives** on a contentious question, serving as a springboard for discussion. By collecting responses anonymously, polling lowers the social barrier to voicing a stance on moral issues ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=In%20many%20fields%2C%20instructors%20want,used%20to%20engage%20in%20a)). The results immediately display the diversity of opinion in the class – for example, the poll might show that 20% answered “Never,” 70% “Sometimes,” 10% “Always.” This data is pedagogically valuable: it validates minority viewpoints (students see some peers share their stance even if it’s not popular) and challenges assumptions (the class cannot assume everyone thinks alike). The instructor can use the spread of answers to structure a debate or **peer instruction** activity: students could first vote individually, then discuss in small groups with those who voted differently, and finally revote to see if opinions shift. Such a sequence encourages students to articulate reasons and confront counterarguments, deepening their understanding of ethical theories. If a student changes their vote after discussion, it indicates reflection and learning (they have reconsidered their stance), a form of **metacognitive development**. Even if opinions hold steady, students gain practice defending their view with philosophical principles. From the instructor’s perspective, the poll gauges prior conceptions and potential misconceptions (e.g. misunderstanding of a philosopher’s view might be evident if students misidentify which stance is Kantian vs. utilitarian). This is a **formative assessment** that guides how to proceed – the instructor might spend more time clarifying a theory if the poll indicates confusion. Moreover, using a poll for an ethics question makes the session more interactive and personally engaging, as students are invested in seeing how class views align or diverge.  

**Tools:** **Poll Everywhere**, **Mentimeter**, or **Slido** can be used for live multiple-choice opinion polls. They allow anonymous voting and can display results as bar charts or pie charts instantly. For a quick gauge of agreement, even Zoom’s built-in poll or a show-of-hands (reaction icon) could work in online classes, but dedicated polling tools record the data for later analysis. If the instructor wants to capture reasoning as well, some tools enable short free-text responses that can be shared (though discussing them verbally might suffice). For asynchronous classes, the question could be posted on the course LMS or sent via **Google Forms** before a discussion board activity – students submit their stance privately first, then view the compiled results and discuss why different people might answer differently. This sequence preserves the benefit of **initial individual commitment** (each student thinks through their position without being swayed) followed by exposure to others’ ideas, much like the Think-Pair-Share or peer instruction model ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=Crouch%2C%20C,977)).

### Historical Scenario Prediction (Just-in-Time Poll)  
*Example Poll:* In a history course, before delving into a new topic, the instructor presents a brief scenario and asks students to predict an outcome: **“After the stock market crash of 1929, what do you predict happened to employment in the following year?”** Possible answers: **A) It greatly increased**; **B) It remained about the same**; **C) It sharply decreased**. Students vote on what they *think* happened, based on any prior knowledge or intuition. Another example: **“Which factor do you suspect was the MOST important in causing the French Revolution?”** with options like *Economic Crisis*, *Enlightenment Ideas*, *Social Inequality*, *Political Conflict*.  

**How it supports learning:** This use case leverages polling as a **predictions tool** to engage curiosity and assess preconceptions. By asking students to anticipate historical outcomes or causes, the instructor activates their prior knowledge and assumptions. The act of prediction creates an intrinsic motivation to find out the answer – students become more attentive and invested when the actual historical events or analysis are later revealed, to see if their predictions were correct. Pedagogically, this is a form of **formative assessment** and a **conversation starter**. For instance, if a majority of the class incorrectly predicts that employment *increased* after 1929, it signals a gap in understanding of economic history, and the instructor can tailor the lecture to address this (perhaps explaining the timeline of the Great Depression in detail). If predictions on the French Revolution causes are split among all options, it opens a discussion: “Why might someone think X is most important?” Students can share reasoning or what they recall from prior courses, surfacing misconceptions (e.g. maybe many picked *Enlightenment Ideas*, underestimating bread prices – the instructor can then emphasize the overlooked factor). This approach also personalizes the learning – when students later learn the outcome (e.g. unemployment soared in 1930), those who guessed wrong experience a form of **cognitive dissonance** that can make the correct information more memorable (a mild “surprise effect” in learning). Those who guessed right gain confidence and can be prompted to explain their thought process. Additionally, by having students predict *before* the content is taught, the instructor practices **Just-in-Time Teaching**: the poll results gathered (even asynchronously before class) inform what to focus on. If done as a pre-class assignment, the teacher can review responses and adjust the upcoming lesson to tackle any prevalent incorrect assumptions. Overall, prediction polls make students active participants in constructing historical understanding rather than passive recipients of facts.  

**Tools:** This can be executed **synchronously** with a live poll in class (using an app like Poll Everywhere or iClicker to collect answers on the spot). In a face-to-face setting, even a simple show of colored index cards or clickers could be used to register predictions, but digital tools provide a persistent record. **Asynchronously**, tools such as **Google Forms** or an LMS quiz feature are very handy: the instructor posts the question as a ungraded survey for students to complete before the class meeting. The aggregated results (perhaps shown as a chart) can then be displayed at the start of class to launch discussion. Poll Everywhere also allows sharing a poll via a link that stays active – students could be emailed a link to vote on the historical question prior to class, with the instructor downloading results beforehand. The key is to have the responses collected **before** students are exposed to the answer, preserving the integrity of the prediction exercise.

### Language or Terminology Quiz (Retrieval Practice)  
*Example Poll:* In a Spanish language class, after a lesson on past tense conjugations, the instructor might ask: **“Which of these sentences uses the **pretérito** (simple past) correctly?”** and display four short sentences where only one is grammatically correct. Similarly, in a art history lecture on architectural styles, a poll might ask: **“The building shown is an example of which style?”** with options *Gothic*, *Romanesque*, *Baroque*, *Renaissance*. Students must select the correct answer based on the features they see.  

**How it supports learning:** These polls serve as **rapid recall and concept application** checks. In the language example, students are being tested on a rule they just learned – this is essentially using polling for **retrieval practice**. Even a single question that forces students to retrieve information from memory (like the correct verb conjugation or identifying a style from memory) strengthens their learning and retention of that concept ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=allows%20students%20a%20few%20minutes,study%20conducted%20by%20Karpicke%202008)). Because it’s low-stakes and often done immediately after learning (or at the start of next class as a refresher), it’s a formative assessment that helps both students and instructor. Students get to self-assess: *Did I understand the grammar rule? Can I spot the right usage?* If they answer correctly, it’s reinforcing, and if not, the immediate feedback (seeing which answer was right) corrects their misunderstanding before it fossilizes. For the instructor, a quick poll on terminology or facts shows whether the class as a whole is keeping up. If 90% choose the right architectural style, the instructor can confidently move on; if only 50% do, it’s a sign to briefly review distinguishing features of those styles. This use case also maintains engagement by breaking up lecture with a question – it refocuses attention. In large humanities courses (like art history or classics) that might involve a lot of information recall, interspersing polls keeps students mentally active. Additionally, a terminology poll can prompt a bit of peer instruction: if answers vary, the instructor might ask students to turn to a neighbor and defend their choice (“Why did you think the building was Baroque? What clues did you use?”), then vote again. Such peer discussion can clarify nuances (e.g. one student points out the presence of flying buttresses indicating Gothic, helping others). In sum, these quizzes harness the power of **retrieval practice** and **immediate feedback**, which research shows improves long-term learning ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=allows%20students%20a%20few%20minutes,study%20conducted%20by%20Karpicke%202008)). They also function as **confidence checks** – a follow-up question like “How confident are you in your answer?” could even be polled to encourage metacognition about their mastery.  

**Tools:** Just about any student response system works for this purpose. **iClicker** and **Poll Everywhere** are commonly used for language drills or art/history image quizzes; they support multiple-choice questions and can show a histogram of answers. If the instructor wants to display an image (like a photo of a building or a sentence on the projector), Poll Everywhere’s **clickable image** or **image-based multiple choice** feature is useful: you can upload an image and have answer choices associated with it (or even let students click on parts of an image in more advanced tools). For asynchronous reinforcement, the instructor could embed a few practice poll questions in a **Google Form** or on the LMS after class – students take this “mini-quiz” on their own time for extra practice, and the teacher can set it to show the correct answers upon submission. In a fully online course, these polls might be part of a weekly module (ungraded self-checks) to ensure students understand key terms before moving forward.

### Comparative Analysis Poll (Synthesis across Works)  
*Example Poll:* In a world literature course that has covered multiple texts, the instructor asks: **“Which author that we’ve studied this term does the argument in today’s essay most closely resemble?”** The choices list several authors or thinkers from earlier in the course. Students must choose who aligns most with the new reading’s perspective. Another example in a music history class: **“Which of these pieces (A, B, or C) was *also* composed by Mozart?”** after listening to several anonymous pieces – here students vote to identify which piece fits the composer’s style, synthesizing their knowledge of his characteristics.  

**How it supports learning:** This poll type pushes students to engage in **higher-order thinking (analysis and synthesis)** by making connections across different works or ideas. Students cannot answer correctly by recalling a single fact; they must compare the current material with past material. In the literature example, they have to recall the philosophies or styles of authors X, Y, Z and decide which is most analogous – effectively categorizing the new essay’s ideas in context of what they’ve learned. This reinforces long-term retention (since they must bring back knowledge of previous readings) and deepens understanding by requiring application: *“Author X argued something similar about human nature, so I’ll choose X.”* Poll results will show how the class perceives the connections. If one choice is heavily favored, it indicates a consensus that can be explored (“Why do we all think today’s author is like Rousseau?”). If answers are scattered, it opens debate – different students saw different parallels, so each group can explain their rationale, leading to a richer comparative discussion. In either case, it’s a chance for **peer instruction** and explanation, as students justify their classification of ideas. The activity also helps the instructor gauge how well students see the “big picture” themes of the course. If, for instance, few students link the new essay to a thinker who really is foundational, it may mean that connection wasn’t made explicit and needs highlighting. On the other hand, creative or unexpected pairings (a minority of students choosing an author the instructor didn’t consider similar) might reveal novel insights worthy of class discussion. Beyond specific content, this polling use case trains students in the habit of synthesizing and comparing — a critical skill in humanities. By regularly asking such questions, an instructor encourages students to always think about relationships between works, not just isolated understanding.  

**Tools:** **Multiple-choice polling** suffices here; instructors can use Poll Everywhere, Mentimeter, **Top Hat**, or even the built-in polling in presentation software if available. The question can be posed with answer choices on a slide, and students respond via their devices. In some systems, you might allow or encourage selecting more than one if justification is needed (“Select all authors that you think have a similar argument”). If doing this asynchronously, the instructor could post the poll in a shared **Google Sheet or Doc** with a table – e.g. list authors as columns and ask each student to put a mark under who they choose (though this method is less anonymous). A better asynchronous method might be using a Google Form with the question and sharing a summary of responses later. For synchronous classes, showing the poll results live lets the instructor immediately ask follow-ups (e.g., calling on representatives of each choice to explain). Some polling tools also allow a **ranking poll** or a **ranking of matchings**; for example, one could have students rank a set of artworks by date or by adherence to a style as a group exercise in synthesis. If a specific tool doesn’t support a direct ranking question, instructors sometimes improvise by running a series of polls (first ask “Which is most, A or B?”, then “Which is next?” etc.), but multiple-choice is usually simpler and effective for basic comparative questions.

### Metacognitive “Muddiest Point” Poll (Reflection)  
*Example Poll:* At the end of a dense philosophy lecture on Plato, the instructor asks: **“Which concept from today’s class is *least* clear to you right now?”** and provides a list of the major concepts covered (e.g. *Theory of Forms*, *Allegory of the Cave*, *Doctrine of Recollection*, etc.). Students choose the topic they feel most unsure about. Alternatively, the instructor could pose an open-ended question: **“What was the muddiest point in today’s session?”** letting students submit short text responses (one or two words identifying a topic).  

**How it supports learning:** This is a classic use of polling for **formative feedback and metacognition**. By explicitly asking students to reflect on what they didn’t understand or feel shaky about, the instructor encourages them to assess their own learning. This act of identifying one’s own “muddiest point” is metacognitive – students must review the content mentally and pinpoint gaps or confusion, which in itself can help organize their studying (they now know what to focus on). From the instructor’s perspective, the poll provides invaluable real-time feedback on which topics need clarification. For example, if 60% of the class selects *Theory of Forms* as least clear, the teacher realizes that concept didn’t land well and can allocate time to re-explain or give additional examples, either immediately if time permits or in the next class ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=muddiest%20point%20questions%20and%20get,2011)). In a seminar setting, the instructor might even address the top muddy concept on the spot (“I see many of you are unsure about the Cave allegory – let’s revisit that quickly.”). If the poll is open-ended, the teacher might see a word cloud or list of terms students submit; common words popping up signal widespread confusion. This technique was traditionally done with paper slips (“write your muddiest point”) collected at class end, but doing it via a poll is far more efficient, especially in large classes ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=Polls%20can%20be%20a%20useful,of%20the%20next%20lecture%2C%20and)). It allows hundreds of responses instantly, and some tools can aggregate identical answers. Beyond instructor feedback, showing students that their peers also found certain topics confusing can normalize confusion and encourage a growth mindset (“It’s okay that I didn’t get it immediately; many of us didn’t”). The instructor can also use results to shape review sessions or to post an explanation on the course site addressing the most common muddy points. In addition, one can poll for **confidence levels**: e.g. “Rate how confident you are about understanding today’s material (1=very confused to 5=very confident).” Such self-rating helps students think about their learning progress and can be used in tandem with a content question (to see if confidence aligns with actual performance). Overall, polls like this make students active participants in steering the course, and they reinforce the idea that *monitoring one’s own understanding* is part of learning.  

**Tools:** Many systems support anonymous polling of this type. **Poll Everywhere** and **Socrative** both allow open-ended questions where responses can be displayed in a word cloud or upvoted list. Instructors often choose anonymity for a muddiest-point poll so students feel safe admitting confusion. A simple multiple-choice asking “Which of these topics was most confusing?” is easy to set up in Mentimeter or Poll Everywhere – just list the topics. For open text input, Poll Everywhere, Slido, or even a shared **Padlet** wall can work (students post a short phrase about what confused them). If doing it asynchronously, one could use a **Canvas/Blackboard survey** or Google Form at the end of the day for students to submit muddy points; the instructor can then address the top issues in a follow-up email or the next class. There are also dedicated classroom feedback apps that include a “muddiest point” feature. The key is to actually **use the feedback**: students benefit most when they see the instructor respond to the poll results (closing the loop by clarifying tough concepts), which builds trust and encourages future participation.

## Social Sciences

Courses in the social sciences – such as psychology, economics, sociology, political science, anthropology, and education – often discuss real-world issues, data interpretation, theories of behavior, and case studies. Polling can be especially powerful in these fields to gather opinions, make predictions about social phenomena, and test understanding of conceptual frameworks. It can also turn the class into a source of data for analysis. Below are several use cases tailored to social science classrooms, illustrating both in-class interactive polling and asynchronous survey-style polls.

### Social Issue Attitude Poll (Gauging Opinions)  
*Example Poll:* In a sociology or political science class, an instructor asks: **“Do you support the policy proposal to cancel student loan debt up to $10,000?”** with answers **Yes**, **No**, or **Not Sure**. Alternatively, it could be a spectrum: **“On a scale from 1 (strongly oppose) to 5 (strongly support), how do you feel about this policy?”** Students cast their votes on this real-world issue.  

**How it supports learning:** Polling student attitudes on a current social issue serves multiple pedagogical purposes. First, it **engages** students by tapping into their personal opinions and making the class content relevant to their lives. Seeing the poll results gives immediate insight into the class’s stance – perhaps, for instance, 65% support, 25% oppose, 10% unsure. This information is a perfect discussion starter: *Why* do we hold these views? The instructor can have students discuss reasons behind their votes, bringing course concepts into the analysis (e.g. linking to sociological theories of public opinion or political socialization). It also exposes students to the diversity of perspectives in the room, which is valuable in social sciences that examine how backgrounds or ideologies influence views. Importantly, the anonymity of polling encourages honest responses on sensitive topics ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=In%20many%20fields%2C%20instructors%20want,used%20to%20engage%20in%20a)). Students who might hesitate to voice a unpopular opinion can still be counted, ensuring the instructor hears from *all* sides, not just the majority or most vocal. This makes subsequent discussion more inclusive and informed – the teacher can deliberately invite arguments supporting minority positions knowing some students hold them. Moreover, attitude polls can be used **before and after** a unit to measure change. For example, polling support for a policy at the start of a module, then teaching about its economic and social implications, and polling again at the end can reveal shifts in opinion. Students engage in metacognition when they see how their stance might have changed or solidified after learning new information. It prompts them to reflect on *why* they changed their mind or what evidence influenced them. This mirrors how real public opinion can shift with information, making a great lesson in critical thinking and the impact of knowledge on attitudes. Finally, such polls provide a low-stakes way to introduce controversy: the focus is on aggregate results rather than putting anyone on the spot, which can lower the emotional temperature while still tackling contentious issues.  

**Tools:** **Poll Everywhere**, **Mentimeter**, and **Slido** are well-suited for quick opinion polls. They allow single-choice or Likert scale questions and can present results graphically (bar chart or pie chart). In a classroom with clicker devices (like **iClicker**), the instructor can pose the question verbally or on a slide and have students press their choice – clickers have historically been used in large psychology lectures to poll opinions on ethical scenarios or social questions, with aggregated responses shown immediately. For an asynchronous approach, instructors might deploy a **Google Forms** survey or an LMS-based poll prior to class. For instance, in an online course, the professor could post a weekly “hot topic” poll on Monday, then reveal and discuss results during a live session or in a discussion board on Friday. Collaborative documents are less needed here since dedicated polling tools handle anonymity and counting better, but one could use a shared document or forum for a follow-up, such as prompting students to write a short justification of their vote (with their identity, if they choose) after the anonymous poll. This hybrid approach (anonymous vote + identified explanation in writing) can enrich the learning experience by combining privacy for the vote with accountability for reasoning in a safe manner.

### Predictive Poll for Experiment Outcome (Psychology Demo)  
*Example Poll:* In a psychology class covering cognitive biases, the instructor asks: **“Compared to the average student in this class, do you consider your driving skills to be...** 1. **Above Average**, 2. **Average**, or 3. **Below Average**?” Students select one of the three options. (This is a classic setup to demonstrate the “better-than-average effect.”) Another example in economics: **“If the federal reserve raises interest rates next month, what do you predict will happen to unemployment?** A) It will increase, B) It will decrease, C) It won’t change.” Students vote on their predicted outcome.  

**How it supports learning:** This use case asks students to **predict the result of an experiment or scenario** before knowing the answer, harnessing a similar strategy to the prediction in humanities but now often tied to empirical facts or psychological effects. In the driving skills poll (drawn from a real psychology experiment), typically the vast majority of students rate themselves as “above average” and very few say “below average.” When the results show, for example, 80% Above, 20% Average, 0% Below, it creates an immediate teachable moment: not everyone can be above average, so the class as a whole is displaying overconfidence – exactly the bias the instructor intends to discuss. The poll didn’t just passively gauge knowledge; it *generated data* that makes the concept concrete. Students often react with surprise or laughter when they see the skewed results, which makes the lesson on the better-than-average effect memorable. This illustrates how **active learning** via polling can surpass a lecture in impact: students effectively participate in a mini-experiment and observe the outcome in real time ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=Example%201%3A%C2%A0The%20instructor%20asks%20%E2%80%9CCompared,average%20effect)). In the economics example, the poll taps students’ intuitive understanding of monetary policy. Perhaps many vote that unemployment will *decrease*, when in fact theory (and evidence) might predict it will *increase* if interest rates rise (due to reduced spending). By revealing the class predictions and then comparing to economic principles, the instructor can address misconceptions (e.g., clarifying the inverse relationship between interest rates and employment in the short run). The prediction commits students to an answer, which makes them more likely to pay attention to the explanation that follows – they want to know if they were right or wrong and why. This approach aligns with **peer instruction** as well: if the initial vote is all over the place, the instructor might have students discuss in small groups (“why do you think X will happen?” for each option) and then vote again. Often, peer discussion leads some to correct their reasoning, resulting in a larger share choosing the theoretically correct answer on the second vote ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=Crouch%2C%20C,977)). This shows students the value of reasoning and evidence. Additionally, these predictive polls can inject a sense of discovery and scientific thinking: students form a hypothesis (the poll choice), then see data (either the class result in psych or actual economic data if the instructor brings it in), then update their understanding – essentially modeling the scientific method in miniature. It turns a lecture into an interactive investigation, which is highly engaging.  

**Tools:** Any polling tool that supports multiple-choice questions can be used. **Poll Everywhere** and **Mentimeter** are great for displaying the results immediately as a bar graph which is important for the visual impact in these examples. Traditional **clickers** (like those by iClicker or TurningPoint) were often used for exactly these kinds of concept tests and demonstrations in large psychology classes; they remain effective, though phone/web-based systems are more common now. If the instructor wants to integrate the poll with a demonstration, they could do it in steps – e.g., use a **Zoom poll** during an online demonstration, or have students fill a **Qualtrics** survey predicting outcomes of several scenarios as pre-lab work. In a hybrid or asynchronous setting where an actual live reveal isn’t possible, the instructor might collect predictions via a Google Form and then share the compiled results in a announcement or the next lecture video, followed by the explanation. The key feature needed is anonymity and one-response-per-student (so they answer honestly without peer influence). For the psychology bias example, **Slido** or Poll Everywhere word cloud could even be used if the instructor asks for a single word describing themselves compared to average (most might type “above” or synonyms), but multiple-choice is simpler for quantification. After the lesson, the same poll might be run again in a later class or on an exam as a conceptual question (now asking, “What bias was illustrated when 80% of you said above average?”) to reinforce the learning.

### Case Study Application Poll (Classification)  
*Example Poll:* In an introductory psychology course learning about conditioning, the instructor describes a short case: *“Jane’s dog excitedly runs to the kitchen every time it hears the sound of the can opener, because it has learned that this sound means food will be served.”* The poll question then asks: **“In terms of classical conditioning, the sound of the can opener is an example of:** A) an unconditioned stimulus, B) a conditioned stimulus, C) an unconditioned response, D) a conditioned response.” Students vote on the correct classification for the stimulus in this scenario. In a political science class, a poll might present a scenario about a government’s action and ask: **“Which theory best explains this decision?”** listing theories like *realism*, *liberalism*, *constructivism* as options.  

**How it supports learning:** Here polling is used to assess and improve **application of concepts to examples**, which is crucial in social sciences. In the psychology example, students must take the abstract terms from conditioning theory and identify which one fits the concrete scenario of the dog and can opener. This goes beyond rote memorization – they have to understand the roles of stimulus and response. Polling the answers allows the instructor to immediately see if students can correctly apply the terminology. If a large number choose a wrong answer (say many choose “unconditioned stimulus” instead of the correct “conditioned stimulus”), it indicates a common misunderstanding that can be addressed in the moment (perhaps students are confused about what counts as conditioned vs unconditioned in this context). The instructor can then explain why the sound is *conditioned* (learned association with food) and not *unconditioned*. This kind of **diagnostic question** is very useful as a formative assessment: it checks for **conceptual understanding** rather than simple recall ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=Conceptual%20Understanding)). It can also spark peer discussion – students who chose different answers can pair up to defend their choice, often leading those who misunderstood to correct themselves when they hear the reasoning of a classmate (for example, a peer might say “Food was the unconditioned stimulus, the can opener was originally neutral and became conditioned,” which could enlighten someone who was mixed up). The political science example would similarly reveal if students can match theory to real-world case. Perhaps the votes are split between realism and constructivism; the instructor can then facilitate a discussion: “Why did some of you think it was realism? What evidence supports that?” and “What about constructivism? What factors in the case lead to that interpretation?” Such dialogue helps students practice **synthesis and justification** using theoretical frameworks. Polling ensures every student has committed to an answer, which means everyone has done the mental work of analysis – this is more effective than just asking the class aloud and hearing from one or two volunteers. It also means the instructor isn’t fooled by a few confident students explaining correctly while others might be lost; the poll results give a transparent view of class-wide understanding. Over time, using these application polls can train students to read scenarios critically and pick out key details that determine which concept applies, a critical thinking skill in social sciences.  

**Tools:** **Classroom response systems** like Poll Everywhere, **Kahoot!**, or Top Hat are commonly used for these concept application questions. Kahoot, for example, adds a gamified element (students get points for correct answers fastest) which some instructors use to liven up review sessions with scenario-based questions. Poll Everywhere or Mentimeter might be preferred in a less game-like context because they allow more discussion around the results without the focus on competition. In smaller classes, even a **show of hands** could technically work to gauge answers, but digital polling gives anonymity (preventing embarrassment over wrong answers) and precise counts. For asynchronous classes, the instructor could pose a weekly scenario in a forum and give a poll or quiz for students to classify it, then discuss in writing why the correct answer is correct. Tools like **Socrative** and Canvas quizzes allow multiple-choice questions with instant feedback, so a student taking it on their own can immediately see an explanation of the answer after responding. Google Forms quiz mode could also be used to present a scenario and then show the correct answer explanation upon submission. A collaborative document approach might involve students posting their own example scenarios and having peers vote on the classification, which could be a creative assignment building on this use of polling for application.

### Class Data Collection Survey (Collaborative Dataset)  
*Example Poll:* In a statistics or sociology class, the instructor creates a short poll asking students a few questions about themselves – for example: **“How many hours did you sleep last night?”**, **“Do you consider yourself an introvert or extrovert?”**, **“What is your favorite social media platform?”** Students submit their answers (which might be numerical for the first question and multiple-choice for the others). The instructor then uses the aggregated results as a mini dataset for a class exercise. For instance, they might compute the average hours of sleep from the class data or cross-tabulate personality (introvert/extrovert) with favorite platform to see if there’s a trend.  

**How it supports learning:** This polling use case turns the class into research participants to generate **real, relevant data** for analysis. In subjects like statistics, research methods, or any social science dealing with data, using student-generated data makes the abstract concepts more concrete. Students are typically more interested in data that describes *them* than some canned dataset. For example, if the average sleep in the class poll turns out to be 6.1 hours, the instructor can ask the class: “Is this higher or lower than you expected?” and then perhaps demonstrate how to construct a confidence interval or standard deviation using that data. Because students provided the raw inputs, they have a personal stake and intuitive feel (each student knows how much they slept, so they can see how they contribute to the average and variance). It also humanizes data – rather than just numbers, those data points are tied to classmates. In sociology, collecting data on, say, social media usage and then showing a bar graph of the class’s preferred platforms (e.g. 50% Instagram, 30% TikTok, 20% other) can lead to a discussion on social trends and whether the class mirrors broader national statistics. If differences appear (maybe 0% Facebook in the class vs. national data showing some usage), that prompts analysis of demographic differences (the class might be younger than the general population, etc.). This exercise illustrates survey methods and the idea of samples in a hands-on way. It also fosters a sense of **collaboration**: everyone contributed a piece of information to create a bigger picture. The immediate feedback of seeing the aggregated results can be gratifying and piques curiosity (“Oh, most of us are extroverts – interesting, I thought it’d be the opposite”). Another learning aspect is **data literacy**: by engaging with data about themselves, students can practice interpreting graphs or summary statistics. The instructor can ask questions like “Looking at this histogram of sleep hours, what do you notice?” to have students articulate observations (maybe it's skewed, or bimodal, etc.). Because it’s their own data, students often find it easier to reason about patterns. If the class is large enough, the data might even mimic real distributions (e.g., a roughly normal distribution of sleep hours). This approach can also be used as an ice-breaker early in the term (learning about classmates via data) or as an ongoing project (tracking something over time). In research methods classes, an anonymous poll on personal behaviors or beliefs can later be used to teach statistical tests (e.g., “Let’s see if there’s a correlation between hours of study and exam scores – here’s data from our poll and exam 1”). Students seeing their own responses being analyzed can demystify the research process and show relevance.  

**Tools:** For real-time data collection, **Poll Everywhere** and **Mentimeter** allow multiple questions in one poll (sometimes called a survey mode or a series of polls). An instructor could push out a poll with several items and then display results one by one. However, for more complex analysis, using a **Google Form** or **Qualtrics** survey might be better, since the instructor can easily download the responses as a spreadsheet. For instance, the teacher could send a Google Form link at the start of class, give students 2 minutes to fill it with a few questions, then quickly project the summary graphs from the form or load the data into Excel/R to demonstrate an analysis. Some learning management systems have polling or survey tools that integrate with the gradebook (for participation points) – these could be used if anonymity isn’t crucial. A fun low-tech variation is using sticky notes or index cards (each student writes a number, e.g. hours of sleep, and sticks it on the board, then the class together creates a plot), but digital polling is faster and more precise. **Collaborative docs** could be used: e.g. a shared Google Sheet where each student enters their data in a row. This gives instant raw data visible to all, though one has to be cautious about privacy if questions are sensitive (one might avoid names or assign random IDs). In summary, the tools range from any simple polling app for quick questions, to more robust survey tools for larger data sets – the choice depends on whether the goal is a quick show of hands visualization or an actual dataset for analysis. Notably, this approach blurs the line between “poll” and “survey,” but in a learning context, the difference is minor – the idea is student input at scale.

### Values Ranking Poll (Prioritization Exercise)  
*Example Poll:* In a public policy or economics class, the instructor asks students to imagine they are setting a national budget. A poll question is posed: **“Rank the following in order of priority for spending: Education, Healthcare, Defense, Environment.”** Students might not be able to literally rank in a single poll depending on the tool, so the instructor could do this by polling each item one by one (“Which should get the highest priority?” then remove it and ask of the remaining, etc.) or by using a special ranking poll feature if available. Alternatively, a simpler approach: **“Which area should receive the largest share of funding?** A) Education, B) Healthcare, C) Defense, D) Environment.” Students vote for the top priority.  

**How it supports learning:** This use case engages students in **evaluation and synthesis** – they must weigh different values or needs against each other, which is a higher-order thinking skill. By forcing a choice (or a ranking), students have to apply criteria and make a judgment call, just as policymakers do. The immediate benefit is sparking discussion: if the class overwhelmingly chooses “Education” while only a few choose “Defense,” the instructor can ask why education is seen as most important and explore whether that aligns with various political ideologies or evidence of social return on investment. If some choose “Defense,” those students can articulate concerns about security or other reasons. This naturally brings in course content: for example, in a poli-sci context, this poll could segue into discussing how liberal vs. conservative governments prioritize differently, or in economics, discussing opportunity costs and trade-offs. Polling also shows how consensus or division exists within the class on complex issues. If results are mixed, it highlights that reasonable people rank values differently – a learning moment about pluralism or the influence of personal background on priorities. From a learning perspective, articulating why one priority should trump others forces students to recall and apply facts (e.g. “Healthcare should get the most because our readings showed health outcomes strongly influence economic productivity”) or ethical frameworks (“Environment should be first due to the long-term stakes for sustainability”). It’s also a **perspective-taking** exercise: after seeing poll results, the instructor might challenge students to consider arguments for the less popular options, thus broadening their understanding. In some cases, instructors run such polls twice: initially to get gut reactions, then after a structured debate or presentation of data about each category, they poll again to see if opinions shift. That can underline how information and arguments can change priorities – a key lesson in policy studies. Additionally, this kind of poll can lead into teaching about **decision-making processes** like voting systems or consensus-building. For example, if a simple majority poll yields “Education” as top, the instructor could discuss how in real committees, members negotiate to allocate some resources to each, etc. On a more personal level, a ranking poll makes students aware of their own values and how they align with others. It adds an interactive, game-like element to classes that might otherwise be abstract (budget numbers or theoretical principles). By simulating a real prioritization task, it grounds theory in practice.  

**Tools:** Polling for ranking can be a bit tricky since not all platforms have a built-in ranking question type. Some, like **Mentimeter**, do offer ranking polls where students can drag items in order; others like Poll Everywhere might require creative workarounds (e.g. asking a series of questions or using a **survey mode** to let students assign points to items). In a live class, one straightforward method is to do successive polls: Ask “Which should get highest priority?” (take the winner), then “Which of the remaining should get next priority?”, and so on. This was often done even with clickers in the past, though it takes a few minutes. For a quick single choice (like pick the top priority), any multiple-choice poll works (Poll Everywhere, Slido, etc.). If doing it paperless but without fancy software, the instructor could use a **shared Google Sheet** where each student writes a rank order in one cell (e.g. “Edu > Env > Health > Def” for their order) and then the instructor quickly tallies how many put each first – though this is cumbersome in real time. A more engaging variant is to use an **online collaborative board**: list the four budget categories on a Padlet and have students drop a star or vote on them; Padlet can allow each student to like/vote on posts, effectively turning it into a priority voting board. For asynchronous classes, an instructor could use a Canvas quiz configured to accept a ranking question (some LMS have question types for ordering). Qualtrics also has a rank-order question type which could be sent out before class, with results discussed later. Regardless of method, the instructor should visualize the outcome – e.g. showing a bar chart of how many put each category first, second, etc. (Qualtrics or Google Forms summary can do this if structured properly). Notably, the WUSTL teaching center gave a similar example poll for ranking budget priorities ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=on%20evolution%3F%E2%80%9D)), indicating this is a tried-and-true exercise in social science education.

### Peer Instruction with Conceptual Conflict (Economics Example)  
*Example Poll:* In an economics class covering supply and demand, the instructor asks: **“If the government sets a price ceiling on gasoline below the market equilibrium price, what is the most likely result?”** Options: A) **Shortage of gasoline**, B) **Surplus of gasoline**, C) **No change in the market**. Students vote on the outcome. Suppose the initial poll shows a split – perhaps 55% choose “Shortage” and 45% “Surplus.” The instructor then says, “Discuss with a neighbor why you chose your answer,” and after a couple minutes, polls the same question again.  

**How it supports learning:** This scenario is a classic **peer instruction** technique applied to social science content. The initial poll surfaces a **common confusion or misconception** – in this case, students might be confusing price ceilings with price floors, or not recalling which causes shortages vs surpluses. The near 50/50 split indicates many students have an incorrect understanding. Instead of the instructor immediately lecturing, they leverage peer instruction: students who answered “Shortage” (which is correct in this scenario) will explain to their peers that a ceiling (a max price) set low leads to excess demand and hence a shortage, whereas “Surplus” is the result of a price floor. Those who answered “Surplus” have to articulate their reasoning, and may realize in discussion if it’s flawed. When polled again, typically one sees a higher percentage now choosing the correct answer (say the second vote might become 85% Shortage, 15% Surplus) ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=Crouch%2C%20C,977)). This shift demonstrates **learning in action** – through polling and debate, students themselves resolve the confusion. The instructor can then confirm the correct answer and clarify any remaining points, but much of the heavy cognitive lifting was done by students. This method has been shown to improve understanding and retention of difficult concepts (it originated in physics education via Eric Mazur, but works in any field where conceptual misunderstandings occur). The polling aspect is critical: it provides the *prompt* and reveals the disagreement. Without polling, many students might not realize there’s a disagreement or might not commit to an answer, so the discussion would be less focused. Polling also adds a bit of friendly pressure – each student has made a choice, so they are somewhat invested in defending or reconsidering it during discussion. Furthermore, the instructor gets measurable feedback: if after discussion the poll still shows many wrong answers, they know to spend more time addressing the issue. If it jumps to nearly all correct, they can confidently move on, knowing peer explanation worked. This technique also boosts **engagement** and accountability; students can’t just passively listen, they have to think and participate. It often energizes the room because students get to talk and even argue a bit – transforming a potentially dry econ concept into an interactive learning experience. Over time, regularly using peer instruction polls teaches students a valuable habit: to critically evaluate their own reasoning and learn from others, which is a form of collaborative learning and metacognition (realizing “Oh, I was mistaken and here’s why” or solidifying “I was right and I can explain it”).  

**Tools:** Peer instruction can be done with any system that allows repeated polling of the same question. **Clickers** were traditionally used (ask question, collect votes, display results, discuss, ask again). Now, tools like Poll Everywhere or Top Hat can do the same; the instructor might need to clear the results between votes or have a duplicate question ready to launch. Some systems have a built-in “re-poll” feature. The key is to not show the correct answer after the first vote – just show distribution, let them debate, then vote again and finally reveal the answer. This can be managed manually by the instructor (simply not saying which is correct until after round 2). In an online class, breakout rooms can facilitate the peer discussion step, with the poll integrated in Zoom or via web link. For asynchronous classes, true peer instruction is harder, but one could simulate it on a discussion board: post a poll, have students comment on why they chose what they did and respond to each other over a couple of days, then reveal the correct answer in an announcement. That loses real-time element, but still engages students in explaining reasoning. In-person, many instructors use **iClicker** or **TurningPoint** clickers for this because they integrate with slides and can store session data. But a simple approach is **Plickers** (printed QR code cards students hold up that an instructor app scans) if technology is limited – that still allows polling without every student needing a device. Overall, the tool just needs to support anonymity (so students aren’t embarrassed by initial wrong answers) and instant result aggregation. Peer instruction polling is one of the most research-backed uses of classroom response systems to improve learning outcomes ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=Crouch%2C%20C,977)), so many modern platforms specifically support it.

## Sciences

Science courses – including physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, computer science, and related fields – have been early adopters of classroom polling (often via clickers) because of the well-documented benefits for conceptual understanding. In the sciences, polls can probe students’ grasp of difficult concepts, address common misconceptions, and involve students in scientific reasoning and problem-solving during class. Both in lectures and labs, polling can make learning more interactive. Below are use cases of polling in science courses, illustrating a range of strategies from concept tests and predictions to problem-solving and reflection. 

### Physics Concept Test (Misconception and Peer Instruction)  
*Example Poll:* In an introductory physics class covering Newton’s laws, the instructor asks: **“A heavy truck and a light car collide head-on. Which vehicle experiences a greater force from the collision?”** Options: A) **The truck**, B) **The car**, C) **They experience equal and opposite forces**. Students vote individually. (This is a known concept question where the correct answer, by Newton’s Third Law, is C – equal forces – but many beginners intuitively think the smaller car gets a bigger force.) After seeing the initial results (often many choose “the car”), the instructor has students discuss in pairs or small groups to argue their answers, then polls again to see if more answer correctly after discussion.  

**How it supports learning:** This use case is a specific instance of using polling to confront a **common misconception** in science. Physics education research has identified numerous points where student intuition deviates from the correct concept (like thinking heavier objects fall faster, or in this case, that big objects hit harder than they get hit). By asking a carefully crafted multiple-choice question that includes the common wrong belief as an option, the instructor can **diagnose** misconceptions in the room ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=Correcting%20Common%20Misconceptions)). When students respond, if a significant portion picks the misconception (e.g. “the car experiences a greater force”), it’s an opportunity for learning. Through **peer instruction** (as described earlier), students will discuss – often a student who answered correctly (“equal forces”) will explain Newton’s Third Law to their peer, or they might recall the law together and realize the correct answer. Polling a second time usually shows a marked increase in the correct answer after debate, which is a strong indication that students have resolved the misconception ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=Crouch%2C%20C,977)). Even if some still hold it, the instructor can then address it explicitly, knowing exactly how many and which misconception is at play. This immediate feedback loop – pose question, get responses, facilitate discussion, provide explanation – is far more effective than a lecture monologue. Students are actively engaged in **sense-making**. They also experience a bit of cognitive dissonance if they answered incorrectly and hear a convincing argument for the correct answer, which is actually a productive state for learning because it prompts them to adjust their mental models. The anonymity of polling ensures students aren’t afraid to commit to an answer; even if they were wrong, it’s not public, but they still learn from seeing the aggregate result and discussing. Moreover, these concept tests often lead to those “light-bulb moments” where a tricky principle finally clicks – doing that in class via a poll means it happens with guidance, rather than a student remaining confused until homework or exams. Over the term, regular use of concept questions teaches students that physics (and other sciences) are about reasoning, not just plugging into formulas – it cultivates a habit of qualitative thinking. There’s evidence that this method improves conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills long-term. In large lectures, polling may be the only practical way to involve hundreds of students in thinking through a concept question simultaneously and revealing their thoughts to the instructor.  

**Tools:** Physics pioneered the use of **clickers**, and any clicker system or polling app can handle conceptual multiple-choice questions. **iClicker**, **Top Hat**, Poll Everywhere, or **Socrative** are commonly used. The key features needed are the ability to pose multiple-choice questions and show a histogram of responses quickly. Many physics instructors use specialized question banks (like Conceptests) in conjunction with polling. If the class is online, the polling can be done via Zoom polls or a web-based system integrated into slides (some use **Learning Catalytics** or other platforms designed for STEM polling). For asynchronous situations, it’s tougher to do peer discussion, but an instructor might use an online discussion board: pose the question, have students post answers and explanations, then reveal the correct answer later – not as dynamic, but still engaging them with the misconception. In person, often after the second vote the instructor shows the correct answer and possibly a demonstration or simulation to reinforce it (for instance, using force sensors to show the truck and car force are equal). Poll results could be exported for grading participation if desired, but many do it just for learning benefit. There are also some **physics education apps** (like **Phywhisperer** or **Learning Glass** setups) that allow polling, but mainstream tools suffice. The polling question can also be reused in exams or quizzes; studies have found students who practiced with such polling questions perform better on similar questions later ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=Crouch%2C%20C,977)). Essentially, the tool is less important than the pedagogy here – even a show of hands or colored cards (ABC cards) could work to poll, but digital systems make it seamless and save time.

### Chemistry or Biology Demonstration Prediction  
*Example Poll:* In a chemistry lecture, the instructor sets up a demonstration: two clear solutions are mixed in a beaker. Before actually mixing, she asks the class via poll: **“What do you predict will happen when these two solutions are combined?”** Possible answers: **A) The mixture will remain clear**, **B) It will turn cloudy/precipitate forms**, **C) It will change color**, **D) It will get hot (temperature rises)**. Students vote on the outcome they expect. In a biology class, an example might be: **“If a plant is grown in green light only, what do you predict will happen to its growth compared to normal light?”** with options like *grows better*, *grows worse*, *no change*.  

**How it supports learning:** Polling students on the outcome of an experiment or demonstration before showing it engages them in **scientific thinking and hypothesis formation**. Instead of passively watching the instructor do a demo, students are now intellectually invested – they have made a prediction that will be confirmed or refuted. This approach leverages **curiosity** and the psychology of anticipation in learning. When students predict, they are activating their prior knowledge or mental models of how chemistry or biology works. For instance, a student might predict a precipitate forms because they recall a similar reaction in lab last week – even if incorrect, that attempt to connect knowledge is valuable. After the poll, the instructor performs the demo (e.g., mixing the solutions), and suppose the actual result is that it *turns cloudy and gets hot*. Now students compare the outcome to their votes. Those who predicted correctly feel reinforcement; those who did not are often surprised, which creates a prime moment for learning – *why* did that happen, and why was my prediction wrong? The instructor can then explain the reaction (perhaps an exothermic precipitation reaction) and address any specific misconceptions revealed by the poll distribution. For example, if many thought it would change color (maybe confusing this reaction with another), the instructor can clarify differences between reaction types. This method ensures that students process the demonstration at a deeper level; instead of the demo being a magic show, it becomes an experiment where they were active participants in the scientific process. It also encourages **metacognition**: students reflect on their own thinking when they see the outcome (“I expected X, but Y happened – where did my reasoning go astray?”). Over time, consistently asking for predictions trains students to approach science empirically – to always consider what should happen according to theory and then test it. This can be especially beneficial in developing intuition for complex systems in biology or chemistry. Additionally, it makes class more fun and interactive: students often get excited to see if their prediction comes true, and a surprising result can create a buzz in the room. In lab classes, this approach can be used similarly: ask students to predict the result of an experiment or even their data trend before they conduct it, which can lead to better hypothesis-driven lab work. Using polling to gather predictions in lecture also helps the instructor identify how students are reasoning. If, say, most of the class predicts the plant will *grow better* in green light, this might signal a misunderstanding of photosynthesis (perhaps they think “green light = green plant color = good”, whereas actually green light is least effective for photosynthesis). The instructor then knows to address that misconception in the ensuing discussion. This strategy directly ties into the idea of **experiential learning** in lecture – students experience the scientific method in a microcosm by predicting and observing outcomes ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=In%20experiment%20driven%20pooling%20questions%2C,corrected%20through%20the%20experimental%20demonstration)).  

**Tools:** Polling predictions is straightforward with any system – multiple-choice is usually fine. The instructor should ensure everyone votes *before* proceeding with the demo to not spoil the effect. Tools like Poll Everywhere or Mentimeter can display the prediction results without revealing which is correct (since it’s about to be observed). In an in-person class, sometimes instructors use colored cards (each option corresponds to a colored card students hold up) to gauge predictions quickly; however, digital polls have the advantage of anonymity and precise tally. If the class is doing this asynchronously (say, in an online module), the instructor might present a video up to a point, then pause and ask a poll question (“What will happen next?”) using an LMS quiz or H5P interactive video, and then resume the video to show the result. Some systems like **Panopto or EdPuzzle** allow embedding quiz questions into videos for exactly this purpose. For in-person labs, instructors could use a poll at the start of lab (“Predict your result”) and maybe award a small bonus for a correct prediction (not to incentivize guessing, but to reward hypothesis formulation – this depends on the teaching philosophy). The tools don’t need special features beyond standard question formats. If an open-ended prediction is desired (letting students type their hypothesis), one could use an open text poll, but evaluating a variety of answers is harder live – multiple-choice is easier to aggregate. In large lectures, the polling approach to demos has been popular, and instructors often prepare common misconceptions as the answer choices. Notably, this technique was recommended by many teaching centers to increase engagement in science lectures ([What Works: Classroom Polling Ideas to Engage Students | Center for Teaching Innovation](https://teaching.cornell.edu/classroom-polling-ideas#:~:text=to%20actively%20engage%20students%20in,peers%2C%20and%20generate%20new%20ideas)). It’s also often combined with follow-up concept questions to ensure students understood the explanation of the result.

### Real-Time Problem Solving Poll (Math/Engineering)  
*Example Poll:* In a calculus class, the instructor displays an integral problem: ∫ (2x + 1) dx. Before working it out, she polls: **“What is the first step to solve this integral?”** Options: A) **Use substitution**, B) **Use integration by parts**, C) **Integrate term-by-term**, D) **It’s already straightforward – just integrate directly**. Students vote on the strategy. In an engineering class, the instructor might ask during a circuits problem: **“Which law should we apply first to analyze this circuit?”** – options could be *Ohm’s Law, Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law, Kirchhoff’s Current Law, Node Analysis formula*, etc.  

**How it supports learning:** This use case uses polling to scaffold **problem-solving processes**. Instead of only quizzing the final answer, the instructor is checking if students know how to start or which approach to use – an essential skill in math and engineering. By polling the class on the method, the instructor forces students to actively think about problem strategy, not just passively watch the teacher do it. In the calculus example, suppose a large majority selects “integrate term-by-term” (which is correct, since ∫(2x+1)dx is straightforward polynomial integration). That tells the instructor the class recognizes a simple approach – they’re confident. The instructor can then quickly carry out the integration, confirming their choice. If, however, many students thought a more complicated method was needed, that reveals overcomplication or uncertainty. The teacher can address it: “Actually, we can integrate directly here; substitution isn’t needed because this integrand is simple. Remember, save integration by parts for products or special forms.” This helps students learn to **choose efficient strategies** and not overuse techniques. In contrast, if it were a harder integral, the poll might show a split (some choose substitution, some parts). The ensuing discussion (or instructor explanation) can clarify which strategy is appropriate and why others are less so. This builds students’ **metacognitive skills** in problem-solving – they start to learn decision-making in approaching problems, not just execution. For the engineering question about which law to apply, the poll results let the instructor know if students can diagnose the problem type. If half the class picks Ohm’s Law but the best first step is KCL (Kirchhoff’s Current Law), the instructor can ask someone who chose the correct law to explain their reasoning or can clarify: “We have a node with multiple currents, so KCL is the natural choice.” This way, the poll becomes a springboard for teaching **problem-solving heuristics**. It also engages students in the process, preventing them from being passive until the final answer is given. They must commit to an approach and thus become more attentive to whether that approach works out. If the poll was about the first step, the instructor might continue solving the problem stepwise, potentially asking another poll at a critical decision point (“Now we’ve simplified, should we apply formula X or Y next?”). Each poll chunk breaks a complex solution into smaller decisions that students get to practice. This approach combats a common issue in STEM classes: students often can follow along a solution someone else presents, but struggle to generate the solution path on their own. Polling at intermediate steps forces them to practice the *generation* part. It also keeps them engaged throughout a multi-step problem, since they know their input will be needed at any moment. This use of polling transforms problem-solving from a one-way demonstration to a two-way interactive experience. It can also reveal if there are multiple valid approaches – if poll answers are split between two methods that actually both work, the instructor might acknowledge that and perhaps even let different groups try solving with different methods, then compare outcomes. In summary, polling during problem solving teaches flexibility and strategic thinking, and gives the instructor feedback on student proficiency with techniques in real time.  

**Tools:** The polling requirements here are basic (multiple-choice questions), but timing is key – the instructor needs to integrate polls smoothly into the flow of working through a problem. If using **PowerPoint or Keynote**, Poll Everywhere has integrations to insert polls at desired points. Alternatively, an instructor can use an app dashboard to fire a poll when needed. **Top Hat** and **Learning Catalytics** are platforms that some use to pose many questions in sequence during class, which can fit this approach. For quick response in small classes, one could even use colored cards or hand signals (like hold up 1 finger for substitution, 2 for parts, etc.), but digital polling is more anonymous and feasible in large classes. In an online live class, the teacher could use Zoom’s poll feature for a quick multiple-choice on the next step. Another approach is using a sequence of **concept questions** in systems like **Socrative** or Canvas quizzes – though that’s more often used for prepared questions, not on-the-fly problem-solving. If an instructor wants to spontaneously poll a step that students seem stuck on, tools like **Slido** (with its quick launch Q&A/poll from a smartphone) can be handy. Some math classes use **clicker questions** after each concept; applying that to problem steps is analogous. For asynchronous courses, an interactive tutorial could be made where at a certain step a question pop-up asks “What would you do next?” before showing the solution – authoring tools or even a series of quiz questions can achieve that, albeit without the live discussion element. Also, **collaborative documents** can play a role: in a small class, an instructor might have a Google Doc where each group writes the next step, then everyone looks at others’ steps and votes in Zoom poll which is correct. That combines collaboration with polling. Regardless of method, the technology should not slow down the momentum, so instructors often prepare the polls in advance for known tricky points in example problems. Done well, it transforms problem solving into an active learning routine rather than a spectator event.

### Data Interpretation Poll (Graphs & Analysis)  
*Example Poll:* In an environmental science class, the instructor shows a graph of CO₂ concentration (ppm) on the x-axis vs. average global temperature on the y-axis over several decades. The poll question asks: **“What relationship does this graph show between CO₂ and temperature?”** Options: A) **Positive correlation (they increase together)**, B) **Negative correlation (one increases while the other decreases)**, C) **No clear relationship**, D) **Causal proof that CO₂ drives temperature**. Students select the best description. In a biology class, a poll might show a phylogenetic tree diagram and ask: **“According to this tree, which species is most closely related to Species A?”** with multiple-choice options from the tree.  

**How it supports learning:** This use case focuses on **interpreting scientific data or visuals**, a critical skill in sciences. By polling students on what a graph or diagram indicates, the instructor ensures they are actively engaging with the material rather than passively glancing at it. In the environmental science example, students have to recall or infer what correlation looks like on a graph. If the graph clearly shows both CO₂ and temperature rising in tandem, the correct answer is a positive correlation. The poll results will show how well students can read that: hopefully most choose “positive correlation,” but if a significant number choose “causal proof” (D), that’s a flag – students might be conflating correlation with causation. The instructor can then address that specifically: “We see a correlation, but remember, correlation alone isn’t proof of causation. Other evidence is needed to establish causality.” If some choose “no relationship,” the instructor might realize they didn’t interpret the axes correctly or missed the trend, prompting a review of how to read such graphs. Thus, the poll identifies misreadings or misconceptions about data. It also reinforces scientific critical thinking: by including that tempting option about causation, the instructor tests whether students will apply the principle that correlation ≠ causation. In general, polling about data interpretation helps students practice extracting meaning from visual information – whether it’s a trend, a pattern, or a specific detail. In the biology phylogeny example, the poll forces students to apply their understanding of tree topology to identify relatedness. If many get it wrong, the instructor knows to reiterate how to read the tree (e.g. finding the most recent common ancestor). This immediate feedback prevents misconceptions from lingering – it’s far better to catch a misunderstanding about reading graphs during class than to discover it via wrong answers on an exam. Another benefit: it engages students in discussion about *why* an interpretation is correct or not. The instructor can ask, after the vote, “Why did those who chose B think it was a negative correlation? What part of the graph might seem that way?” Perhaps students focus on a short interval where one dips. This can lead to a nuanced discussion about overall trend vs short-term variability, sharpening their data analysis skills. Polls like this also emphasize that science is not just about memorizing facts, but about interpreting evidence – a more active form of learning. By routinely including such questions, instructors encourage students to always examine figures and data critically, rather than glossing over them. In large lectures, it’s easy for students to zone out when a complex graph is shown; a poll ensures they engage, since they know they’ll need to answer a question about it. It can also stimulate peer conversation: “I thought it was no relationship – why do you think it’s positive?” and students can point out parts of the graph to each other, learning to justify their interpretations. Over time, their graph literacy improves.  

**Tools:** The key here is the ability to show an image (graph/diagram) and ask a question about it. **Polling tools** like Poll Everywhere and Mentimeter allow insertion of images in questions. Poll Everywhere even has a “clickable image” question type where students can click on a graph to identify a point or region, but a simpler multiple-choice based on the image is usually sufficient. The instructor can embed the graph in the question slide so students see it while voting on their devices or on the projector. If using Zoom, the poll might not show the image, so instead the instructor shares the screen with the graph and perhaps uses an external poll or simply uses Zoom poll with the text of answers (students have to refer to the shared screen for the image). For asynchronous settings, one could use an LMS quiz where an image is shown and then a question given – this is straightforward in systems like Canvas or Moodle. Another tool is **H5P**, which can create interactive questions on images or charts (like marking hotspots or identifying trends). For in-class use, if technology for images is limited, an instructor might describe the graph and just poll conceptually (not ideal), or use a printed handout of the graph and have students answer via clicker. But typically, a projector or slide can display the visual. The **clickable image** feature (available in Poll Everywhere and Top Hat) can be very engaging – e.g., the instructor could say “Click on the part of the graph where the correlation is strongest” and see a heatmap of clicks – but interpreting that can be complex. Usually a multiple-choice interpretation question as described works well and is easier to discuss. Tools like **Pear Deck** for Google Slides also allow embedding questions about images for student response. If doing an in-person class without digital devices, instructors sometimes use colored cards with letters or a numbered finger system again, but then the graph has to be clearly visible to all and the teacher has to judge the show of hands. Digital is more precise. Once the poll is done, the instructor can even show a professional analysis of the same data (if available) and compare it to how the class answered, reinforcing the lesson. 

### End-of-Class Concept Quiz (Retrieval & Closure)  
*Example Poll:* In a biology class on cell division, the instructor ends the lecture with a short three-question poll (using something like a **Poll Everywhere survey or Kahoot quiz**): for example, **“During which phase of mitosis do sister chromatids separate?”**, with options (Anaphase, Prophase, Metaphase, Telophase); **“True/False: The cell’s DNA is replicated during mitosis.”**; and **“Name one key difference between mitosis and meiosis”** (open-ended or multiple choice). Students answer these on their phones in the last 5 minutes of class.  

**How it supports learning:** This use of polling serves as an **exit quiz** or **retrieval practice** at the end of a class. By quizzing students on key points just covered, it reinforces those points in memory (the act of retrieval solidifies learning ([Types of Polling Questions - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/polling-activities-and-questions/#:~:text=allows%20students%20a%20few%20minutes,study%20conducted%20by%20Karpicke%202008))). It also gives both students and instructor a quick gauge of what was understood. If most students get the chromatids question right but falter on the DNA replication question, that signals a lingering confusion (perhaps some mixed up mitosis with the cell cycle as a whole). The instructor can take a minute to clarify: “Looks like many thought DNA replicates in mitosis – actually replication happens before mitosis, in S phase of interphase. Mitosis is the division of already duplicated DNA.” That timely correction can prevent the misunderstanding from persisting. For students, getting a question wrong at the end of class is valuable feedback – it tells them *now* that they didn’t grasp something, so they know to review it soon, rather than finding out much later on an exam. It also promotes metacognition: students leave class thinking about what they understood versus what needs more work. When done regularly, end-of-class polls encourage students to **actively listen and take notes**, knowing that they’ll be asked about the content. It can improve knowledge retention since the process of recalling answers shortly after learning acts as spaced reinforcement. Moreover, it provides a sense of closure to the class session – students can walk out with a clearer idea of the day’s take-home messages. Some instructors even use the results for a participation grade or simply to identify which students might need extra help. In large lectures, an exit poll might reveal patterns (e.g., if only 40% answer all questions correctly, the instructor might decide to revisit some material next time or provide additional resources). In smaller classes, the instructor could address individual misconceptions if the system identifies who responded with what (though anonymity often yields more honest answers, so many do it anonymous and focus on group trends). This strategy also touches on **retrieval and spacing** – if the instructor revisits these same questions at the start of the next class (another quick poll without warning), it further reinforces learning by spacing out practice, which is a proven technique. For instance, the next class could begin, “Pop quiz: recall yesterday’s poll questions!” via polling again. Over time, such repeated retrieval helps build long-term retention of foundational facts and concepts, which is crucial in cumulative subjects like science. Using polls for this rather than paper quizzes means instant feedback and zero grading overhead, making it feasible to do frequently. It also tends to be less intimidating; students often find it “fun” or at least low-pressure, especially if framed as practice rather than for points. As Chapman University’s teaching blog notes, using Poll Everywhere as exit tickets where students rate understanding can promote active learning and responsibility for one’s learning ([Poll Your Way to Success: Using Poll Everywhere to Enhance Student Reflection and Learning - Higher Ed and Technology: Academics at Chapman](https://blogs.chapman.edu/academics/2023/03/06/poll-your-way-to-success/#:~:text=Exit%20Tickets%3A)). Here we couple content questions with perhaps a final self-rating (“On a scale of 1–5, how well do you feel you understood today’s material?”) to get both cognitive and affective feedback. All combined, the end-of-class poll wraps up the session by consolidating learning and informing next steps.  

**Tools:** **Kahoot!** is popular for end-of-class quizzes because it adds a gamified element (leaderboards, points for speed) which can energize students at the end of a session. However, Kahoot primarily focuses on multiple-choice and true/false. **Poll Everywhere** or **Mentimeter** can run a series of questions (basically a mini-quiz) including multiple-choice and short answer. Poll Everywhere also can be used for exit tickets asking for the “muddiest point” or a self-rating ([Poll Your Way to Success: Using Poll Everywhere to Enhance Student Reflection and Learning - Higher Ed and Technology: Academics at Chapman](https://blogs.chapman.edu/academics/2023/03/06/poll-your-way-to-success/#:~:text=Exit%20Tickets%3A)), as described earlier. **Google Forms** could be used: share a link in the last slide, students fill in answers which can be set to show correct answers immediately (if it’s a quiz form). The instructor can review the Forms summary later. If the class is not too large, another approach is simply asking those questions verbally and using a show of hands or flashcards, but that’s less precise. In online classes, using the LMS quiz at the end of a module can serve the same function (with automated feedback). Some instructors use **exit polls for attendance or participation** tracking – tools like Top Hat integrate attendance with polling. One caution: to ensure honest responses (especially to self-assessment questions), it may be better to keep the poll anonymous or ungraded, or graded only for completion, not correctness. This encourages students to admit if they didn’t understand something. The technology can be configured accordingly (Poll Everywhere can collect identifiable responses or not, depending on settings). For open-ended “what was the most confusing part” questions, some tools allow students to upvote each other’s responses – but at class end there might not be time for that, so the instructor would just review them after class. As long as the students have a device or browser access, these end-of-class polls take only a few minutes and most tools can handle it seamlessly. Many LMS also have mobile apps where teachers can quickly push out a poll – so the infrastructure is widely available to implement this with minimal hassle.

Each of these use cases demonstrates how polling can be adapted to a variety of disciplines and purposes: from checking basic recall to provoking deep discussion, from gathering opinions to simulating experiments, and from guiding problem-solving to encouraging reflection. Whether conducted in real-time during class or asynchronously as pre- or post-class assignments, polls make learning interactive and provide immediate insights into student thinking. By using tools like **Poll Everywhere**, **Mentimeter**, **Kahoot**, **Google Forms**, or even simple collaborative documents, instructors can implement these strategies to create a more engaging and responsive learning environment. The ultimate goal is to use polling not as an isolated gimmick, but as an integral part of pedagogy – supporting formative assessment, increasing student engagement, enhancing metacognition, and fostering the kind of active learning that leads to deeper understanding. The examples above can serve as inspiration for designing an enhanced classroom polling platform that caters to diverse disciplinary needs and pedagogical strategies, ensuring that polls are not only about asking questions, but about opening pathways to learning.
