# Overview of In‑Class Quiz Types in Higher Education

## Introduction  
In-class quizzes are short assessments administered during class sessions to gauge learning and reinforce key concepts. Unlike extracurricular trivia contests, academic quizzes are structured to support teaching and learning goals. They can take many forms – from traditional paper quizzes to modern digital polls – and serve a range of purposes. This overview organizes quiz types by their **purpose**, **format**, **frequency**, **stakes**, and **instructional goals**. Understanding these variations can help instructors and curriculum designers choose the right quiz modality for their classroom. We cover classic formats (like multiple-choice vs. open-ended), well-known examples (pop quizzes, clicker questions, etc.), and innovative approaches. Throughout, we highlight how each quiz type aligns with either formative practice or summative evaluation, and how it can be used to engage students and improve learning.

## Purpose and Stakes: Formative vs. Summative Quizzes  
One fundamental distinction is between **formative** and **summative** quizzes. Formative quizzes are low-stakes checks on learning, used throughout a course to provide feedback and guide improvement. They help identify misconceptions or gaps “along the way” and are **not primarily for final grades** ([Formative and Summative Assessments | Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/Formative-Summative-Assessments#:~:text=Assessment%20allows%20both%20instructor%20and,In%20short%2C%20formative%20assessment%20occurs)). Summative quizzes, by contrast, are higher-stakes assessments of knowledge at the end of an instructional unit or course, typically **graded and weighted more heavily** ([Formative and Summative Assessments | Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/Formative-Summative-Assessments#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20summative%20assessments%20evaluate,ways%20to%20combine%20these%20approaches)). In practice, “weekly quizzes” or in-class polls are often formative, while a midterm “quiz” or unit test serves a summative role ([Formative and Summative Assessments | Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/Formative-Summative-Assessments#:~:text=Examples%20of%20Formative%20and%20Summative,Assessments)). Below, we detail common quiz types aligned with these purposes:

- **Low-Stakes Formative Quizzes:** These quizzes aim to enhance learning rather than assign a major grade. They are usually brief, happen frequently, and carry little to no point value (or only participation credit). For example, **concept-check quizzes** are quick in-class checks for understanding after a lesson segment. An instructor might pose one or two questions to verify students grasped a concept just taught – a form of immediate formative feedback. **Pop quizzes** (unannounced quizzes) also fall in this category when used as learning checks. A pop quiz is a surprise short quiz with no prior warning, often used to ensure students keep up with readings or coursework. Because they occur spontaneously, pop quizzes encourage consistent preparation and attention. Research with undergraduates found that administering anonymous pop quizzes (e.g. via multiple-choice questions) helped **identify problem areas in understanding and even boosted class attendance** ([Pop Quiz! Are They Necessary for Remote Classes? - Crowdmark](https://crowdmark.com/pop-quizzes-during-remote-education/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20have%20sought%20to,also%20helped%20boost%20class%20attendance)). However, if heavily graded or too frequent, pop quizzes can induce anxiety and may hurt exam performance for some students ([Pop Quiz! Are They Necessary for Remote Classes? - Crowdmark](https://crowdmark.com/pop-quizzes-during-remote-education/#:~:text=However%2C%C2%A0another%20study%C2%A0of%20undergraduate%20medical%20students,students%20not%20performing%20as%20well)). Many instructors therefore keep pop quizzes low-stakes – sometimes not graded at all or counted only for participation – so that the quiz **reveals learning gaps without penalizing students** ([Pop Quiz! Are They Necessary for Remote Classes? - Crowdmark](https://crowdmark.com/pop-quizzes-during-remote-education/#:~:text=Remote%20education%20provides%20an%20excellent,gaps%20in%20understanding%E2%80%94without%20penalizing%20students)). In fact, evidence suggests **ungraded pop quizzes** can improve final exam results by reducing stress and focusing students on recall practice ([Pop Quiz! Are They Necessary for Remote Classes? - Crowdmark](https://crowdmark.com/pop-quizzes-during-remote-education/#:~:text=Ungraded%20pop%20quizzes%C2%A0can%20play%20a,it%20being%20graded%20is%20eliminated)). Other examples of formative quizzes include **reading comprehension quizzes** at the start of class (to check that students did the assigned reading) and **practice quizzes** that let students test themselves with no grade impact. All these formative uses share an instructional goal: to provide feedback and reinforce learning (often leveraging the testing effect, where retrieval practice strengthens memory) in a **nonthreatening, low-pressure environment**.

- **High-Stakes Summative Quizzes:** These quizzes are graded assessments used to evaluate student learning after a chunk of instruction. They are less frequent and carry significant weight toward the course grade (though usually smaller in scope than a full exam). Summative quizzes typically occur at the **end of a unit or module** to measure mastery of that material. For example, an instructor might give a 20-minute **unit quiz** every few weeks, or a **midterm quiz** covering the first half of the course. Summative quizzes are often formal, scheduled in advance, and closed-book (similar to exams). Their instructional goal is **assessment of learning outcomes** – to see how well students have learned the content – rather than to provide immediate practice. Because they contribute to final grades, summative quizzes must be fair and aligned with learning objectives. Many are essentially mini-exams. (In fact, what one instructor calls a “quiz” might be termed a “test” by another – the terminology can vary.) Even so, summative quizzes need not be extremely high stakes; some instructors use **several small summative quizzes** instead of a high-stakes midterm. For instance, an approach in one study involved multiple supervised quizzes worth 5–7.5% each of the course – these did **not** significantly improve final exam performance compared to fewer quizzes. In contrast, another format with **more frequent, very low-stakes quizzes (open-book, unlimited attempts, each worth only ~2%) led to higher exam scores**, supporting the idea that students learn more when assessments are perceived as low-pressure opportunities to explore knowledge. In other words, even summative quizzes can be made lower stakes and formative in spirit. Nonetheless, truly high-stakes quizzes – such as a single in-class test worth a large portion of the grade – are used when the goal is to rigorously certify what students have achieved (summative assessment) ([Formative and Summative Assessments | Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/Formative-Summative-Assessments#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20summative%20assessments%20evaluate,ways%20to%20combine%20these%20approaches)). In summary, summative quizzes serve as capstones to instruction (often **formally graded and planned**), while formative quizzes are **ongoing tools for learning and feedback**.

## Frequency and Timing: Pop Quizzes, Scheduled Quizzes, and More  
Quizzes also differ in how often they occur and whether they are announced or spontaneous. **Frequency** can range from daily quick checks to a few times per term. **Timing** refers to when the quiz is given (e.g. at class start, end, or mid-lesson) and whether students know about it beforehand.

- **Pop Quizzes (Unannounced):** As noted, pop quizzes are surprise quizzes with no prior notice. They can happen at any time – often at the beginning of class – on any content recently covered or assigned. The element of surprise is meant to keep students consistently prepared. Pop quizzes tend to be short (a few questions) and are usually low in point value (so that one bad pop quiz won’t significantly hurt a student’s grade). Their timing is unpredictable by design. Instructionally, a pop quiz’s purpose is to **spot-check knowledge and encourage regular study habits**. For instance, a language teacher might give an unannounced vocabulary quiz to ensure students reviewed the new words, or a history instructor might pop quiz the reading from last night. An added benefit is that pop quizzes can improve attendance (students don’t want to miss class in case there is a quiz) ([Pop Quiz! Are They Necessary for Remote Classes? - Crowdmark](https://crowdmark.com/pop-quizzes-during-remote-education/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20have%20sought%20to,also%20helped%20boost%20class%20attendance)). However, because they are unplanned from the student perspective, they should be used judiciously; if overused or too punitive, they can cause anxiety or feelings of unfairness. Many instructors mitigate this by **dropping the lowest pop quiz grade**, grading pop quizzes leniently, or using them only for bonus or feedback.

- **Scheduled Quizzes:** These are quizzes announced ahead of time and given on a regular schedule (e.g. **weekly quizzes** every Friday or a quiz at the end of each chapter). Students know when to expect them and what content will be covered. Scheduled quizzes often form a core part of the course assessment plan. For example, an instructor might plan a 10-minute quiz every week on that week’s material. Because they are expected, these quizzes motivate students to keep up with the coursework steadily. Scheduled formative quizzes (weekly or biweekly) provide **continuous retrieval practice** – a strategy proven to reinforce learning and improve long-term retention. In fact, the *frequency* of quizzing is a key factor: regular short quizzes give “ongoing opportunities for retrieval practice,” and extensive research in cognitive psychology documents that **frequent testing improves learning outcomes** (often termed the testing effect). Regular quizzes also tend to improve class attendance and engagement, since students come prepared for the quiz and subsequent review of answers. Some scheduled quizzes are primarily formative (low stakes, meant to practice), while others count toward the grade. A common approach is to make each quiz a small percentage, but have many of them. For instance, a course might have a 5-question quiz every class meeting, each worth only a fraction of a percent – collectively encouraging **consistent study without high pressure on any single quiz**. Scheduled quizzes can also be positioned at specific times: a **“reading quiz” at the start of class** (to assess preparation), or an **“exit quiz” at the end**. An *exit ticket* quiz is usually a single question given in the last few minutes of class to check understanding of that day’s lesson. It’s ungraded or counts for participation, and it helps instructors see if the main points were clear. Similarly, some instructors use **entry quizzes** at the very beginning of class (e.g. a one-question diagnostic on a prerequisite concept or the previous lecture’s material) to activate recall and identify concepts that may need review.

- **In-Class vs. Pre-Class Quizzes:** While our focus is on in-class use, it’s worth noting timing relative to class. Many quizzes are given *during* class time, but quizzes can also bracket a class session. **Pre-class online quizzes** are a popular strategy in flipped classrooms or Just-in-Time Teaching. Here, students complete a short quiz *before* coming to class (often via the learning management system), usually on the reading or video lecture assigned as homework. The instructor reviews the results right before class to identify which topics students struggled with. This “just in time” feedback lets the teacher tailor the upcoming class to address misconceptions. For example, an instructor might assign a 5-question online quiz due by 8am on class day; the system auto-grades it and shows that most students missed question 3, so the instructor spends extra time on that concept in class. In effect, the quiz shapes the in-class activities. These pre-class quizzes are typically low stakes (to encourage honest effort rather than cheating) and formative. On the flip side, **post-class quizzes** or homework quizzes can be assigned right after a class to reinforce what was learned, though those aren’t “in-class” quizzes so much as immediately-after-class assessments.

In sum, quizzes can be unannounced or scheduled, frequent or occasional. Unannounced pop quizzes test on-the-spot preparedness, while regular scheduled quizzes integrate into the course rhythm. The timing (start, middle, or end of class) can align with different goals – diagnosing prior knowledge, checking mid-lesson comprehension, or assessing learning at lesson close.

## Format and Question Types: Multiple-Choice vs. Open-Ended (and Others)  
Quizzes can use a variety of **question formats**, each with advantages for certain goals. The format refers to how questions are structured and how students must respond (e.g. selecting an answer vs. writing one out). In both paper and digital quizzes, a mix of question types might be employed. Below are common quiz question formats used in class, along with their characteristics:

- **Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs):** By far the most popular quiz format, MCQs ask a question and provide several answer options (typically 4 or 5), of which one is correct (or in some cases, “multiple select” questions may have more than one correct). MCQs are favored because they are easy to administer and grade (especially electronically), and can cover a broad range of content in a short time. In fact, one teaching resource notes that **the most commonly used quiz type is a multiple-choice quiz with four answer options** ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=The%20most%20commonly%20used%20quiz,matching%2C%20true%2Ffalse%2C%20short%20answer%20etc)). Well-written multiple-choice questions can assess not just factual recall but also conceptual understanding and even application or analysis (through good distractor choices and scenario-based stems) ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=Quizzes%20are%20widely%20used%20in,written)). MCQs are often used in large classes with clickers or online systems, since they allow instantaneous feedback and aggregation of results. Their downside is that students can guess the answer, and writing high-quality MCQs that test more than memorization can be challenging. However, when designed with plausible distractors (wrong answers), MCQs can effectively target common misconceptions ([Clickers and Peer Instruction | Discipline-Based Science Education Research](https://www.dbserc.pitt.edu/resources/discipline-based-educational-strategies/clickers-and-peer-instruction#:~:text=used%20to%20adjust%20the%20instruction,students%E2%80%99%C2%A0reasoning%20in%20homework%20or%20exams)). They are equally useful in formative contexts (clicker questions during a lecture) and summative contexts (a graded quiz). Variants of MCQs include **true/false** (the simplest binary choice) and **matching** formats, which are described below.

- **True/False Questions:** These present a statement and ask students to judge whether it is true or false. They are quick to answer and easy to grade, so they sometimes appear on quizzes as a rapid knowledge check. For instance, a chemistry quiz might ask: “T/F – All exothermic reactions release heat.” True/false items are useful for covering many small facts or concepts in minimal time. However, because there is a 50% chance of guessing correctly, a string of T/F questions may not robustly assess understanding unless combined with follow-ups or used in quantity. Students can also be thrown off by subtle wording (qualifiers like “always/never”), so T/F items should be written clearly to avoid trickery unless the intent is specifically to test careful reading. Despite their simplicity, T/F questions are a form of **closed-ended** question and thus still fall under the umbrella of easily gradable formats. Many instructors use a few T/F questions at the start of a quiz as a “warm-up” before more complex items.

- **Fill-in-the-Blank Questions:** These require students to supply a missing word or phrase in a statement or formula. For example: “In Freud’s model, the _____ operates on the pleasure principle.” Here, the student must recall and write the word “id”. Fill-in-the-blank (also called completion) items test recall ability more directly than recognition-type questions like MCQs. They are good for key terms, definitions, or exact phrases. In paper quizzes, fill-in answers are handwritten and later checked against the correct answer. In online quizzes, the system can automatically grade fill-in responses, though one must account for spelling or slight variations. This format ensures the student cannot simply recognize the answer – they must produce it from memory, which can better reinforce learning. However, fill-in questions usually only assess fairly specific knowledge (they’re less suited for testing complex ideas) and can be tricky to grade consistently if the answer isn’t a single word. Some digital systems extend this format to **short answer** by allowing a sentence or two to be typed and then using pattern matching or manual review for grading.

- **Matching Questions:** A matching section presents two lists – typically a column of “prompts” and a column of “answers” – and students must match each prompt with the correct answer from the list. This format is common for vocabulary (match terms to definitions), concepts and examples, dates and events, etc. For example, a history quiz might have students match a list of battles with the year they occurred. Matching questions are efficient for testing several pairs of knowledge at once. They also reduce guessing compared to independent MCQs because the process of elimination becomes a factor only as answers are used. Best practice is to include more answer options than prompts (so it’s not one-to-one, which adds challenge) ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=Matching)) ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=Best%20practice%20for%20disambiguation%20would,require%C2%A0more%20Answers%20than%20Prompts)). Matching is typically auto-graded easily online. It works well for assessing associations and relationships. One limitation is that all content in a matching set should be homogenous (all dates, all terms, etc.) or it might confuse students. This format is less frequently used in live in-class polling (since matching is harder to do with clickers), but on paper or LMS-based quizzes it’s quite useful.

- **Short Answer (Open-Ended) Questions:** These require students to generate their own answer in a few words, a sentence, or a short paragraph. Unlike the closed formats above, open-ended questions can assess higher-order thinking by having students explain, interpret, or calculate without given choices. For instance, a short-answer question might be: “Briefly explain two causes of the French Revolution.” Students must recall relevant information and articulate it coherently. Short answers are great for probing depth of understanding, application of concepts, or the ability to synthesize knowledge. **Longer open-ended questions** (essay questions) can appear on quizzes too, though typically quizzes favor brevity due to time constraints. The downside of open-ended formats is that they require manual grading (though some quiz systems allow model answers for semi-automatic grading, it often still needs instructor review). They also take students more time to answer. In an in-class setting, short-answer quizzes might allocate a few minutes per question depending on complexity. While not as common as MCQs for routine in-class quizzes, open-ended questions are used when instructors want to see students’ reasoning or problem-solving process. For example, a math quiz might say “Solve:  $2x + 3 = 11$. Show your work.” – here the answer is short (`x = 4`), but the instructor can check the work for partial credit. Open-ended quizzes provide rich insight into student thinking, aligning well with learning goals that emphasize analysis or synthesis (higher levels of Bloom’s taxonomy ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=Quizzes%20are%20widely%20used%20in,written))). They are often used in smaller classes or in written pop quizzes where quick one-sentence responses can be reviewed on the spot by the teacher or peers.

- **Other Formats:** In digital quizzing, additional question types exist beyond the traditional ones. **Ordering or Ranking questions** ask students to put items in the correct sequence (for example, rank steps of a process). **Drag-and-drop** questions let students categorize or arrange labels on an image or diagram – useful in interactive e-learning quizzes. Some platforms support **hotspot** questions where students click on the correct area of an image. While these are less common in simple in-class quizzes, they represent the expanded possibilities of quiz formats, especially in online or blended classroom settings ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=questions%20and%20four%20answer%20options,matching%2C%20true%2Ffalse%2C%20short%20answer%20etc)) ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=Matching)). Regardless of format, a broad principle applies: to keep quizzes effective, questions should be clearly written and aligned to learning outcomes. For instance, it’s recommended to **avoid overusing binary (true/false) questions or confusing wording (like double negatives)** that could muddle what is being assessed ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=,critical%20thinking%2C%20knowledge%20and%20understanding)). A mix of question types can cater to different learning styles and keep quizzes interesting, but the choice should be guided by the quiz’s purpose (e.g. quick recall vs. critical thinking demonstration).

## Interactive In-Class Quizzes (Clickers and Real-Time Polls)  
With the rise of classroom technology, many instructors now incorporate interactive quizzing during lectures. **Interactive in-class quizzes** involve students responding to questions in real time, often through electronic devices, with aggregate results immediately available to the class. These are typically low-stakes formative exercises designed to engage students and inform teaching in the moment.

- **Clicker Questions:** Clickers are handheld response devices (or nowadays, smartphone apps) that students use to vote in real-time on multiple-choice questions. A question is displayed (on a slide or verbally), students press a button for A/B/C/D, and the system instantly shows how many chose each option. This simple mechanism transforms a passive lecture into an active learning experience. Clicker questions are usually conceptual multiple-choice questions inserted at key points in a class. For example, after explaining a concept in physics, an instructor might pose a conceptual question to test understanding, using clickers to collect answers from the whole room. Students get immediate feedback (seeing if their answer was correct), and the instructor sees the distribution of responses. If a large percentage got it wrong, that signals to review or reteach that point. **Clickers thus serve as a formative assessment tool, giving rapid feedback to both students and teacher** ([Clickers and Peer Instruction | Discipline-Based Science Education Research](https://www.dbserc.pitt.edu/resources/discipline-based-educational-strategies/clickers-and-peer-instruction#:~:text=,uncover%20a%20typical%20unproductive%20way)). They also boost engagement – even shy students participate since answers are anonymous to peers, and it adds an element of gamified challenge. Clicker questions are usually not graded for accuracy in real-time use (or may be counted only as participation credit), which encourages risk-taking and honest answers. According to the Yale teaching center, **in-class clicker questions are a prime example of formative assessment** that can identify misconceptions and guide learning on the spot ([Formative and Summative Assessments | Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning](https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/Formative-Summative-Assessments#:~:text=Examples%20of%20Formative%20and%20Summative,Assessments)). Many instructors report that including a few clicker quiz questions each class keeps students attentive and helps break up lectures with interaction. In terms of format, clicker questions are almost always multiple-choice or true/false, given the need for quick response and automatic grading. (Some systems allow numeric entry or short text, but those are slower to use.) Clicker technology has evolved: traditional clickers were physical devices, but now **web-based polling apps** (like Poll Everywhere, Mentimeter, or Kahoot) let students use their own phones or laptops as “virtual clickers.” The pedagogical effect is similar. Overall, clicker quizzes make the classroom feel more like a two-way conversation – students answer questions as they learn, which can significantly enhance understanding and retention when done well ([Clickers and Peer Instruction | Discipline-Based Science Education Research](https://www.dbserc.pitt.edu/resources/discipline-based-educational-strategies/clickers-and-peer-instruction#:~:text=Peer%20instruction%20using%20clickers%20has,these%20concepts%20posed%20by%20instructor)) ([Clickers and Peer Instruction | Discipline-Based Science Education Research](https://www.dbserc.pitt.edu/resources/discipline-based-educational-strategies/clickers-and-peer-instruction#:~:text=During%20class%2C%20the%20instructor%20briefly,which%20they%20answer%20it%20again)).

- **Peer Instruction Quizzes:** Peer Instruction is a specific interactive technique popularized by Harvard physicist Eric Mazur, which uses quizzes and peer discussion together. In peer instruction, the instructor poses a challenging conceptual multiple-choice question (often called a *ConcepTest*). Students first think and vote on the answer individually (for example, via clicker). Then – crucially – they turn to a neighbor and **discuss their reasoning** for a minute or two. After discussion, students vote again on the same question. The percentage of correct answers often increases after peer discussion, as students teach each other and clarify misunderstandings. Finally, the instructor explains the correct answer and reasoning. This whole process is essentially a sophisticated in-class quiz that leverages peer learning. It transforms a quiz from a solitary assessment into a learning activity. Peer instruction quizzes are typically ungraded or lightly graded (to encourage honest attempts rather than copying). The goal is to help students **develop understanding through explaining and debating with peers**, which is guided by the quiz question ([Clickers and Peer Instruction | Discipline-Based Science Education Research](https://www.dbserc.pitt.edu/resources/discipline-based-educational-strategies/clickers-and-peer-instruction#:~:text=Peer%20instruction%20using%20clickers%20has,these%20concepts%20posed%20by%20instructor)). Key to this method is crafting good questions: often they target known misconceptions and require application of concepts, so that discussion is sparked (a trivial question everyone gets right won’t provoke much peer debate) ([Clickers and Peer Instruction | Discipline-Based Science Education Research](https://www.dbserc.pitt.edu/resources/discipline-based-educational-strategies/clickers-and-peer-instruction#:~:text=used%20to%20adjust%20the%20instruction,students%E2%80%99%C2%A0reasoning%20in%20homework%20or%20exams)). This technique has been shown to improve learning outcomes in many STEM courses. It’s a “quiz” in format (multiple-choice Q&A), but with an instructional goal of **active learning** rather than evaluation. Research notes that peer instruction with clickers gives instructors valuable feedback as well – seeing initial vs. post-discussion answers reveals how student thinking changed ([Clickers and Peer Instruction | Discipline-Based Science Education Research](https://www.dbserc.pitt.edu/resources/discipline-based-educational-strategies/clickers-and-peer-instruction#:~:text=,uncover%20a%20typical%20unproductive%20way)). In summary, a peer instruction quiz is an interactive two-stage quiz: **individual vote, then group discussion, then revote**, all within a few minutes during class. It exemplifies how quizzes can be used not just to assess, but to **promote deeper understanding through social learning**.

- **Live Polls and Audience Response Questions:** Beyond formal clicker systems, instructors often use quick poll questions in class via simple means – even a show of hands or colored cards. For instance, an instructor might ask, “On a scale of 1-5, how well do you feel you understand this topic?” and have students hold up fingers or use an app slider. While not a “quiz” in the traditional sense of right/wrong answers, these live polls are a form of in-class questioning to gauge comprehension or opinion. Some instructors distribute index cards labeled A, B, C, D to each student to serve as low-tech clickers; students raise the card of their chosen answer, giving immediate visual feedback. The modern version uses apps where students respond on their phones to multiple-choice, giving the instructor a live histogram of answers. These audience response questions share the same benefits as clicker quizzes – engagement, feedback, and breaking monotony – and can be integrated seamlessly into a lecture. They might not always be formally counted as a “quiz” grade; often they are considered part of participation. However, they accomplish the quiz’s purpose of checking knowledge. In classes outside STEM, instructors might use polling for opinion questions or predictions (e.g., vote on what you think will happen in a case study before revealing the result). All these interactive polling methods are essentially **in-class formative quizzes that drive engagement**.

- **Real-Time Feedback and Adaptive Questioning:** Some advanced systems can adapt in real-time based on student responses. For example, an instructor might prepare a follow-up question if most of the class gets a quiz item wrong, effectively quizzing further to diagnose the misunderstanding. In live settings, this is often manual (the teacher decides to ask an additional question on the fly). But educational technology is moving toward more adaptive quizzing even during class. While not widespread yet, one can imagine a system where if a student consistently struggles with in-class quiz questions, it serves them an extra review question or two. Current audience tools don’t quite personalize on the spot (since the whole class typically sees the same question), but adaptive learning platforms used in labs or online portions of courses do tailor question sequences. We include this here as an emerging aspect of interactive quizzing: the potential for quizzes to adjust to learners in real time, creating a personalized quiz experience even within a group setting.

## Collaborative and Group Quizzes  
Not all quizzes are individual efforts. Some instructors employ **group-based quizzes** or other collaborative assessment methods in class, turning quizzing into a team activity. These approaches can build communication skills, reduce test anxiety, and let students learn from each other.

- **Two-Stage Quizzes (Individual + Group):** A well-researched collaborative model is the two-stage quiz, often used in Team-Based Learning (TBL) and other active learning strategies. In this design, students first take a quiz *individually* (stage 1), then immediately retake the same or a similar quiz *in groups* (stage 2). One implementation is the **Readiness Assurance Test (RAT)** in TBL ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=A%20popular%20approach%20to%20the,The%20Readiness%20Assurance%20process%20involves)). Here’s how it works: at the start of a class or unit, students individually complete a short quiz on the preparation material (this is the Individual RAT, usually 5–10 questions) ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=,students%20AFTER%20students%20have%20completed)). Right after, they assemble into their small teams and take the *same quiz again as a group*, discussing each question and reaching consensus on the answers (the Group RAT) ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=,again%20at%20a%20later%20date)). The instructor then reviews any difficult questions with the whole class. This two-stage approach has multiple benefits – it holds students accountable individually, but then lets them learn by explaining and debating in the group attempt. The group score can count as part of the quiz grade (often giving an incentive to work together). Studies show that these individual+group quizzes **improve learning outcomes, attendance, and study habits**, because students get immediate corrective feedback and experience peer teaching ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=A%20popular%20approach%20to%20the,The%20Readiness%20Assurance%20process%20involves)) ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=group%20testing%20,The%20Readiness%20Assurance%20process%20involves)). Some use special scratch-off answer cards (Immediate Feedback Assessment Technique) for the group quiz, so that groups get instant feedback if their first answer choice is wrong (they keep scratching until the right answer, with partial credit) – this adds a game element. Two-stage quizzes are an innovative hybrid of assessment and collaboration: the first stage is a traditional quiz, the second stage is essentially a peer instruction discussion with a shared answer sheet. This method embodies the idea that a quiz can be a learning activity, not just an evaluation. It is growing in popularity in higher ed classes that emphasize teamwork.

- **Fully Collaborative Group Quizzes:** In some cases, an entire quiz or test is done in groups rather than individually. For example, an instructor might allow students to work in pairs or triads to complete a difficult problem-solving quiz, turning it into a collaborative exercise. The rationale is that in discussing how to answer, students articulate their reasoning and fill gaps in each other’s understanding. It can also mirror real-world situations where team problem-solving is valued over solo work. One variant reported by educators is to surprise students by saying “This quiz will be done *in groups of 3*, not alone” – instantly reducing stress and promoting rich discussion. These are generally formative or low-stakes assessments, as traditional summative tests are expected to be individual. When groups take a quiz together for a grade, often the same grade is assigned to all members, so clear guidelines and accountability (perhaps requiring consensus on answers or submitting individual reflections after) are important. Group quizzes, if graded, typically count for a modest portion of points to avoid complaints about freeloading. Another collaborative twist is a **quiz tournament** or team quiz game: the class is divided into teams that compete to answer quiz questions (jeopardy-style review games, etc.). While more game than formal assessment, these can be fun review quizzes before an exam. Their instructional goal is engagement and reinforcement of content through teamwork.

- **Peer Writing and Question Generation:** A different form of peer involvement in quizzes is having students themselves create quiz questions or explain answers to each other. For instance, an instructor might assign each small group to write one quiz question about the day’s material to pose to the rest of the class. Generating questions requires understanding the content and can deepen learning; it also produces a pool of practice questions. In class, the instructor can select a few student-written questions for everyone to answer (using clickers or a show of hands). This blurs the line between instructor and student roles in quizzing and is more of a learning activity than an assessment, but it leverages the quiz format. Another approach is **peer grading or review of quiz answers** – for example, students swap papers and grade each other’s short-answer responses using a provided key. This can prompt discussion (“Why did you give that answer?”) and help students see common mistakes. However, peer grading of quizzes is used carefully and usually only for formative feedback, not for official scores, to ensure fairness.

Overall, collaborative quiz formats aim to harness the benefits of social learning. Whether it’s the structured two-stage quiz or an informal team challenge, these methods shift quizzes from being solely assessment tools to also being **interactive learning experiences**. They can increase student engagement, as working with peers is often more stimulating than taking a quiz alone. Moreover, research suggests that collaboration in quizzes, when structured well, can lead to **greater retention and understanding** – students remember discussions and explanations that happened during the group quiz far beyond the class day.

## Gamified and Digital Quiz Approaches  
As technology becomes ubiquitous, many educators are adopting **gamified quizzes and digital platforms** to make quizzing more engaging. These tools often turn a quiz into a game-like experience with points, competition, and immediate feedback, which can motivate students.

- **Game-Based Quizzes (Kahoot, Quizizz, etc.):** One of the most popular trends is using game-based learning platforms to conduct quizzes in class. **Kahoot!** is a prime example – it’s a game-based quiz platform where instructors project questions and students answer on their devices as fast as they can, earning points for correct answers and speed. A leaderboard updates after each question, fueling a friendly competitive spirit. Similarly, **Quizizz**, **Gimkit**, **Blooket**, and others offer colorful interfaces, memes, and music to turn quizzes into a fun game show. The academic content is still front and center (the questions can be about any subject matter), but the delivery feels like a trivia game. Teachers use these for review sessions, formative assessments, or even introductions to new topics by probing prior knowledge. Students often get excited and more invested in answering quiz questions in this format. From an instructional standpoint, gamified quizzes increase participation (even students who might tune out in a normal lecture often perk up during a Kahoot game). They also provide instant data on performance – these platforms show the teacher summary reports of which questions were missed, etc. Importantly, the focus is on **learning through play**: Kahoot’s own description is that it “blends learning with the excitement of gaming” ([Quizlet vs Kahoot!: A comparative guide for educators | The Jotform Blog](https://www.jotform.com/blog/quizlet-vs-kahoot/#:~:text=Quizlet%20and%20Kahoot%21%20give%20educators,to%20transform%20traditional%20teaching%20methods)) ([Quizlet vs Kahoot!: A comparative guide for educators | The Jotform Blog](https://www.jotform.com/blog/quizlet-vs-kahoot/#:~:text=Kahoot%21%2C%20on%20the%20other%20hand%2C,students%20and%20monitoring%20their%20progress)). The competitive element should be managed (emphasize fun and improvement, not just winning). Many of these games allow team modes as well to integrate collaboration. Gamified quizzes are usually low-stakes (no one would use a high-stakes exam on Kahoot) – they are meant for practice, review, or energizing the class. Some criticism includes that students might focus on speed over thinking deeply, or that slower responders feel left out. But with thoughtful use (like discussing each answer after it’s revealed), game-quizzes can be both motivating and educational. They represent an innovative quiz modality that is widely adopted in recent years across K-12 and higher ed for in-class engagement.

- **Online Quiz Platforms and LMS Quizzes:** Many instructors use the quiz tools built into Learning Management Systems (e.g. Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle) or online quiz makers to deliver in-class quizzes via student laptops or tablets. For instance, an instructor might tell everyone to pull out their laptop and complete a 10-question quiz on the LMS in the first 15 minutes of class. The advantages are automatic grading, immediate feedback, and easy tracking of results. LMS quizzes support a variety of question types (MCQ, matching, etc.) and can enforce time limits. In hybrid or large classes, online quizzes can save class time (students might even do them remotely just before class). One caution is academic integrity – in a classroom setting, instructors may still need to proctor to ensure no unauthorized resources are used if it’s a graded quiz. But for low-stakes checks, that’s less of an issue. Some educators prefer digital quizzes in class because they can include multimedia (e.g. an image to label) and because results can be analyzed item-by-item (using item analysis to see which questions were frequently missed, which helps improve future quizzes or clarify content). There’s evidence that **online quizzes early in the term can serve as low-stakes summative assessments that provide valuable feedback** to both students and instructors ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=Low)). Many universities even have policies allowing a significant portion of grades (e.g. 30%) to come from online quizzes ([Using quizzes to evaluate student learning - Teaching & Learning](https://spark.scu.edu.au/kb/tl/assess/using-quizzes-to-evaluate-student-learning#:~:text=Under%20Southern%20Cross%20University%20Assessment,the%20weighting%20of%20a%20grade)). These tools bridge the traditional and the modern: they deliver a conventional quiz experience, but with the efficiency and data collection of technology.

- **Adaptive Digital Quizzes:** Some digital platforms offer **adaptive quizzing**, where the questions adjust based on the student’s performance. For example, if a student is acing all the questions, the system might jump to harder questions; if a student is struggling, it might provide easier questions or additional practice on fundamentals. Adaptive quizzes are common in self-paced learning software, but are emerging in classroom use too. In an in-class setting, an adaptive quiz might be used in a computer lab or for homework, rather than synchronously in a lecture hall (since each student’s path diverges). The idea is to personalize the quiz to each student’s level, keeping them in a productive challenge zone. A study of adaptive quizzes in a first-year course found that students reported **higher motivation and engagement**, and felt the adaptive quizzes supported their learning – although actual exam scores did not significantly increase in that particular pilot ([Adaptive quizzes to increase motivation, engagement and learning outcomes in a first year accounting unit | International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education | Full Text](https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-018-0113-2#:~:text=Adaptive%20learning%20presents%20educators%20with,result%20of%20the%20introduction%20of)). This suggests adaptive quizzes are great for practice and confidence, but they may need to be combined with other instruction to translate to performance gains. Adaptive quizzing is an innovative approach that aligns with the trend of personalized learning: it’s like each student taking a slightly different quiz tailored to their needs. While not yet commonplace in every classroom, the concept is influential. Some textbook publishers provide adaptive quiz programs (often called “personalized learning suites”) that instructors can assign. As technology advances, we may see more real-time adaptive quizzing even within class, where algorithms deliver questions on the fly based on student responses. For now, adaptive quizzes represent a forward-thinking modality that some instructors are experimenting with to better **meet individual students’ learning needs**.

- **Instant Feedback and AI-Assisted Quizzing:** Another emerging digital enhancement is the use of AI to provide richer feedback or even generate questions. For instance, some systems let students answer an open-ended question and then an AI evaluates the response to give immediate feedback or hints, effectively turning what used to require manual grading into a formative quiz that can be done in class. There are also AI quiz generators that can create practice questions from lecture content, which instructors might curate and use. While these tools are still developing, they point toward a future where **quizzes can include more open-ended responses with real-time automated feedback**, and where instructors can easily deploy new questions based on up-to-the-minute class progress. One concrete example: certain math courses use computer algebra systems that allow students to input an algebraic answer and immediately tell them if it’s correct or not, letting them try again – an immediate feedback loop that helps learning. Similarly, language classes might use software to evaluate short written answers for grammar. These aren’t “types of quizzes” per se, but technological enhancements that broaden what’s feasible in an in-class quiz (beyond the classic scantron multiple-choice). As AI integration grows, instructors may incorporate, say, an open-response quiz question in class that the computer evaluates for key points, giving students instant pointers on what they missed. This would combine the depth of open-ended questions with the agility of quick feedback, an exciting development in quiz modalities.

- **Mobile and Blended Learning Quizzes:** With virtually all students carrying smartphones, some instructors design quizzes that leverage mobile usage in class. We’ve covered clicker apps and game apps – additionally, there are microlearning quiz apps that send quizzes to phones periodically. In class, a teacher might ask students to use a particular app that presents quiz questions interleaved with the lecture (some apps can push questions at set times, or the instructor triggers them). In blended learning models, students might go through a module on their device during class that includes embedded quizzes. The flexibility of mobile quizzing means a quiz no longer has to be a static paper at a fixed time – it could be spread out, answered on personal screens while discussion happens around it. For example, in a lab session, students might complete a quick quiz on a tablet at each station to verify they understand the task. This modality emphasizes **integrating quizzing seamlessly into learning activities**, using technology to make it feel natural and immediate.

In summary, digital and gamified approaches have expanded the repertoire of in-class quizzes. These range from highly structured LMS quizzes to playful Kahoot games. The unifying idea is to make quizzing more engaging, efficient, and in some cases individualized. Gamified and tech-enabled quizzes often **lower the stakes feeling** (because the format is fun or novel) while still providing serious learning benefits like practice and feedback. For instructors, these tools can lighten grading load (automated scoring) and provide analytics (item analyses, score distributions) to inform teaching. The key is to align the use of technology with the learning objective – e.g., use Kahoot for energizing review, use an adaptive quiz for differentiated practice, use online quizzes for quick assessment – rather than tech for tech’s sake. When used appropriately, these digital quiz modalities can significantly enhance student motivation and participation in class.

## Emerging and Innovative Quiz Types (Research and Future Directions)  
Educational research continually suggests new ways to leverage quizzes for learning. Some of these approaches are already in pilot use, while others are theoretical or just gaining traction. In this concluding section, we highlight a few **innovative or emerging quiz types and strategies** that instructors and designers might consider, even if they are not yet mainstream:

- **Mastery-Based and Adaptive Quizzing:** Building on the adaptive quizzes mentioned earlier, mastery-based quizzing is an approach where students take quizzes repeatedly (or questions from a question bank) until they achieve mastery of the material. In a classroom setting, this could mean offering “quiz retakes” or weekly mastery quizzes that students must pass at an 80% level, with multiple attempts allowed. The idea stems from mastery learning models and the benefits of repeated retrieval. Some courses now use online systems where each student’s quiz is drawn from a pool and adapts to their weaknesses – essentially, each student has a personalized path to mastery. This approach is supported by research on **retrieval practice and spaced repetition**, which shows that recalling information multiple times over spaced intervals dramatically improves retention. In practice, an instructor might have a set of 100 practice questions for a module and the system keeps giving each student new ones (or rephrased ones) until they consistently get them right, possibly even during class “quiz practice” sessions. While not a traditional single quiz, it’s a new modality of continuous assessment until mastery, facilitated by technology. This aligns assessment with learning more closely than ever – quizzes are not one-shot evaluations but part of an iterative learning loop.

- **Confidence-Based Quizzes:** A novel twist gaining attention is to have students indicate their confidence in each answer and factor that into scoring or feedback. The Faculty Focus publication describes an “innovative quiz strategy” in a pharmacy course where after each question, students rated how confident they were in their answer (e.g., 5 = absolutely certain, 1 = just guessing) ([An Innovative Quiz Strategy](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/educational-assessment/an-innovative-quiz-strategy/#:~:text=Beginning%20with%20the%20mechanics%3A%20students,Immediately%2C%20correct)). After answering individually and indicating confidence, students then collaborated and could change answers (as described earlier), and confidence ratings were collected again. Scoring was then weighted: correct answers earned more points if the student was confident, whereas incorrect answers incurred a larger penalty if the student was sure (and a smaller penalty if they admitted they were guessing) ([An Innovative Quiz Strategy](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/educational-assessment/an-innovative-quiz-strategy/#:~:text=An%20interesting%20scoring%20mechanism%20was,a%20%E2%80%9Cguessed%E2%80%9D%20answer%20was%20acknowledged)). The goal of such a system is to encourage metacognition – students must reflect on whether they really know something or are unsure. It rewards knowing what you know (and knowing what you *don’t* know). In a classroom, one might implement a simpler version: ask students to put a star next to the question on their quiz they feel least confident about, etc., and then use that for discussion. Confidence-based quizzing is backed by the idea that **calibrating confidence can improve learning** – students become more aware of their understanding. While the scoring aspect is more common in research experiments or certain medical education assessments, any instructor can incorporate the concept by discussing not just what the correct answer is, but also how sure students were and why some felt unsure. This is an emerging area that marries assessment with self-assessment.

- **Hybrid “Unquiz” and Discussion-Based Assessments:** Some pedagogical innovations challenge the very format of quizzes. For example, the *unquiz* is a strategy where the quiz is turned into a learning conversation. One professor reported a technique where instead of a standard quiz, the instructor allowed students to ask questions about the material first; if the discussion addressed those questions well, it essentially **counted as the quiz** and everyone got credit for participating. In other words, students demonstrated their learning through the questions they asked and answered together, rather than through a written quiz. This kind of approach blurs formative assessment with class activity. It’s “unquiz” in the sense that it doesn’t look like a traditional quiz, but it serves a similar purpose (ensuring students engage with the content) without the pressure. While unconventional, it speaks to a broader trend of making assessments more dialogic and student-driven. Another example is providing the quiz question in advance as a focus for discussion, and then quizzing immediately after the discussion. These hybrids aim to maintain the benefits of quizzes (accountability, coverage of material) while reducing stress and promoting higher-order thinking.

- **Open-Book and Resources-Integrated Quizzes:** Traditionally, quizzes are closed-book to test memory and comprehension. An emerging perspective is that allowing notes or books can shift the focus of a quiz to application and analysis rather than pure recall. Some instructors experiment with **open-note quizzes**, telling students they can use their own notes (or even textbooks) during the quiz. The expectation is that questions will be correspondingly more complex (since students can look up basic facts). The benefit is students are encouraged to take good notes and truly understand how to use resources. In one report, a professor allowed notes in quizzes and even encouraged *collaboration* on note-taking, and found that this approach **resulted in significantly higher final exam scores** in a research methods course. The combination of open-note and collaborative quizzing in that case helped students learn the material more deeply. While open-book quizzes are not new, the innovative angle is using them regularly in class as a learning strategy (rather than only for big exams). They mirror real-world conditions where information is available, so the quiz can target understanding and problem-solving. This is still not very common for everyday quizzes, but it’s a thought-provoking direction: quizzes could be less about “what do you remember” and more about “can you find and synthesize the information.” 

- **Student-Generated Quizzes:** Inspired by constructivist pedagogy, some educators involve students in creating quiz content. For example, towards the end of a course, an instructor might assign each student to contribute one question (with answer) that they think would be good for a quiz on the material. These can then be compiled (with editing) into a revision quiz or even used on the final exam. The act of generating quiz questions forces students to think like a teacher and identify what is important – a strong learning experience in itself. It also reveals what students consider the key points (or what they might be confused about). In class, one could have a small-group activity: each group writes a quiz question on an index card, then the cards are shuffled and each group answers another group’s question. This turns quiz creation into a collaborative exercise and can uncover interesting angles on the content. While student-generated quizzes are more of a pedagogy technique than a formal assessment type, they represent an innovative use of the quiz format to engage higher-order thinking and peer learning. Some studies have shown that when students create questions for each other, it can improve their understanding and exam performance, likely because it requires deeper processing of the material.

- **Integration of Quizzes with Retrieval Practice Schedules:** The science of learning has highlighted the power of spaced repetition and interleaving (mixing topics) for long-term retention. An emerging idea is to design **quiz sequences that revisit key concepts multiple times across the term**. Instead of quizzes that only cover the most recent topic, these would systematically include a few questions on earlier material as well (spaced retrieval). For example, a course might have a policy that each weekly quiz has 2 questions on that week’s content and 1 question reviewing a previous unit. This is not a different “format” of quiz, but an innovative structuring of quiz content to harness cognitive benefits. Over time, such cumulative or interleaved quizzing can greatly enhance retention of past material and help students connect concepts from different parts of the course. This approach is informed by research but not yet standard practice in all classrooms due to time constraints and the temptation to “quiz and forget.” However, it aligns quizzes with the goal of continuous learning. Some instructors also use **cumulative team quizzes** at the end of the course as a fun review – like a final challenge where groups answer questions spanning the whole curriculum, sometimes as a competition. While the primary purpose is review, it also provides data on what areas might need last-minute clarification before final exams. We include this here as an example of pedagogical innovation: thinking strategically about quiz content distribution for maximum learning, rather than only immediate assessment.

- **Multimedia and Simulation Quizzes:** As a forward-looking point, there is exploration of more immersive quiz experiences. For instance, in medical or engineering education, a quiz might involve a **simulation** – the student is presented with a scenario (through a video or interactive software) and must make decisions, which are then scored. This could happen in class with the right setup (e.g., showing an animation and asking, “What should the next step be? A, B, C, or D?”). Alternatively, augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) could be used to create interactive quiz environments (imagine a field geology class where an AR app presents outcrop samples and quizzes students on identifying features as they view them). These kinds of quizzes are still experimental and require resources, but they point to how the definition of a quiz might expand beyond text or static questions. The goal remains the same: prompt the student to retrieve knowledge or apply skills – but the presentation could be far richer. Such methods engage students by situating questions in real-world contexts, potentially improving transfer of knowledge.

In conclusion, the landscape of in-class quizzes is diverse and continually evolving. From the venerable pop quiz to the high-tech adaptive quiz, each type serves particular instructional goals. **Traditional quizzes** (multiple-choice, short answer, etc.) remain staples for gauging learning, especially when used in low-stakes, formative ways to guide both teaching and studying. **Interactive and collaborative quizzes** have shown how student engagement and understanding can be boosted by making quizzing an active, even social, exercise (as seen with clickers and peer instruction). Meanwhile, **digital innovations** offer convenience, engagement, and personalization that were not possible with pen-and-paper quizzes. Finally, insights from educational research are inspiring new quiz modalities – ones that blur the line between assessment and learning activity, emphasize mastery and retrieval practice, and leverage students as contributors to the assessment process. 

For instructors and curriculum designers, the key takeaway is that “quiz” can mean many things: a diagnostic poll, a formal test, a competitive game, a group problem-solving session, and more. Each modality has its place. When designing a course, one should consider what mix of quiz types best aligns with the course outcomes and student needs. **Low-stakes formative quizzes** (like concept checks and clicker questions) are excellent for providing continuous feedback and encouraging engagement. **High-stakes summative quizzes** (like unit tests) are important for evaluating achievement and incentivizing cumulative study. **Varied formats** (multiple-choice, matching, open-ended) can address different levels of cognition and skills. And incorporating some of the **innovative approaches** – such as collaborative two-stage quizzes, gamified reviews, or spaced cumulative questions – can greatly enrich the learning experience. Quizzes, in all their forms, are more than just assessment tools; they are powerful pedagogical instruments. By thoughtfully choosing among the many types of in-class quizzes, educators can enhance student learning, motivation, and ultimately success in higher education classrooms.
