# **Summer 2025 Sprints Planning Framework**

## **Background: Origin of the Sprint Concept**

In the world of project management, a **“sprint”** refers to a short, focused period of work dedicated to achieving specific goals. The term comes from *Agile* software development, where a sprint is a time-boxed iteration (often 1–4 weeks) for a team to complete a set of tasks or user stories. Each sprint has a clear objective and results in a tangible increment or deliverable that can be reviewed and improved. Crucially, sprints are cyclical – teams plan work at the sprint’s start, collaborate intensively to execute it, then review outcomes at the end before starting the next cycle. This iterative rhythm allows for continuous improvement and responsiveness to feedback.

Meanwhile, the design industry developed its own sprint methodology via *design thinking*. A **design sprint** (pioneered at Google Ventures by Jake Knapp around 2010) is a fast-paced, five-phase process for answering design problems through prototyping and user feedback. Like agile sprints, design sprints are highly time-constrained (often just 5 days) and emphasize interdisciplinary collaboration, rapid ideation, and early testing of ideas. The goal is to reduce the risk of pursuing a new idea by validating it quickly with prototypes and real users. In essence, both agile and design sprints seek to spark innovation and learning by compressing work into short, creative bursts. They create a sense of urgency and focus, encouraging teams to be **creative but results-oriented** – trying bold ideas on a small scale, producing something concrete, then learning from that experience. Over the past decade, these sprint techniques have spread beyond tech. Many fields now use “sprints” or hackathon-style workshops to tackle challenges in a focused timeframe. For example, educational development programs have adopted sprints to help teachers bridge theory to practice quickly. The common thread is a belief that **time-bound, collaborative effort** can unlock creativity and rapid progress in any domain.

&#x20;*Sprint workshops often involve collaborative brainstorming, such as using sticky notes to capture and organize ideas. This hackathon-like approach, born in tech, leverages time constraints to prompt intense teamwork and innovation.*

## **Rationale: Sprints in a Teaching & Learning Context**

Adapting the sprint model to a university **teaching and learning center** offers several benefits. Our center’s summer work typically involves research & development: creating new resources, improving programs, and building capacity for the upcoming academic year. These projects can greatly benefit from the structure that sprints provide:

* **Structured Collaboration:** Sprints give our multidisciplinary staff a common framework to work together on a challenge. Instead of each person tackling summer tasks in isolation, we form a temporary team around a theme or problem for a week or two. This *“disciplined collaboration”* creates space for sharing ideas and skills across our varied expertise – much like teachers in a “Teaching Sprints” professional development cycle learn together and *“draw on the expertise of their peers, ask questions, and celebrate collective progress”*. By working in sprint mode, technical staff, administrative staff, and pedagogy specialists can contribute their unique perspectives while still focusing on a joint outcome.

* **Focused Creativity with Accountability:** Each sprint’s short deadline encourages creativity (try a new approach – there’s little time for bureaucracy or perfectionism) *and* keeps us results-oriented (by Friday we need something to show). For example, if we dedicate a week to “video automation,” the team might brainstorm inventive ways to automate video editing or transcription on Monday and Tuesday, but by Friday we aim to produce a demo or prototype of a video workflow using those ideas. The sprint format ensures that our summer R\&D is not just open-ended tinkering; it’s **creative but with a clear end-product** in mind every cycle. This balance is ideal for our academic context, where we value experimentation but also have tangible outputs to deliver (reports, training materials, etc.).

* **Process-Focused Learning:** In addition to producing a “product” each sprint, the team benefits from reflecting on the **process**. Sprints include built-in moments for review and retrospection. In Agile, teams hold a sprint review and a retrospective to discuss what went well and what can be improved. In our context, this means staff can continuously refine how we work together and what tools or methods are effective for us. For example, one sprint might reveal that a certain workflow (say, using a shared Airtable database) greatly improves collaboration – that learning can then be applied in subsequent weeks. The emphasis on process aligns with our identity as a learning organization: we are not only creating deliverables, but also **improving our team’s skills and workflows** incrementally. This mirrors the idea behind educational “teaching sprints,” where small cycles of practice help educators get better at what they do by iterative refinement. In short, sprinting through our summer work makes the *way* we work a key focus alongside *what* we produce.

* **Adaptable to Multiple Projects:** Another advantage is that sprints can be thematic, which helps organize diverse projects in a coherent way. Other academic units have found success with thematic sprint approaches. For instance, the University of Maryland’s Teaching and Learning Transformation Center runs a multi-week “Design Sprint” to help faculty redesign courses, with weekly focuses like building community in the classroom, inclusive practices, effective use of the LMS, and so on. This shows that a sprint structure can be applied to various teaching-related goals, from course design to faculty training, by focusing each short sprint on a concrete theme. We can similarly divide our summer work into thematic sprints so that, for example, all efforts in one week contribute to a common objective (be it improving our reporting systems or developing materials for training). This helps prevent overload and context-switching – each sprint team knows the *one big thing* they are tackling that week. Over the summer, as we rotate through different sprints, we cover all our priority areas in turn. The end result is a summer that is both **comprehensive and manageable**: every important initiative gets dedicated time and a team, and no one project derails progress on another.

In summary, using sprints at the Bok Center can structure our summer R\&D work in a way that is collaborative (we solve problems together, not in silos), **disciplinary** (each person brings their discipline-specific skills to the table), innovative (we encourage trying new ideas), goal-oriented (weekly deliverables), and reflective (we learn and improve each cycle). This agile approach is well-suited to the dynamic, creative nature of teaching and learning projects. It ensures that by the time the fall semester arrives, we have not only produced useful resources and programs, but also grown as a team in our capacity to support teaching at the university.

## **Methodology: Applying Sprint Techniques to Summer Projects**

To implement sprints in our context, we will blend practices from agile and design-thinking with the realities of academic project work. Below is a description of how we will run the sprints, including their structure and some guiding frameworks for themes:

* **Sprint Structure and Activities:** Each sprint week will be organized roughly into phases: **Plan → Execute → Review.** We begin Monday by defining the week’s focus and end-goals (what **deliverable** or outcome we aim to have by Friday). The team for that week (drawn from our staff) will clarify roles and generate ideas on Day 1. Mid-week (Days 2–4) is for execution: hands-on work such as developing content, configuring tools, prototyping a solution, etc. This is also when we encourage trying new techniques – for instance, “manipulating the stuff with AI and other tools” mid-sprint to see how novel tools can improve our work. We’ll incorporate quick daily check-ins (a stand-up meeting each morning) to keep everyone aligned on tasks and to surface any roadblocks or insights. By the end of the week, we reconvene for a **show-and-tell or demo session** where each sprint team member shares what they built or learned. This echoes the sprint review in Scrum (demonstrating completed work) and allows the whole staff to benefit from each sprint’s achievements. Finally, the team does a brief **reflection** on Friday: What went well? What was challenging? What should we do differently in the next sprint? (This is our sprint retrospective moment.) We will capture these lessons – for example, if a Tuesday brainstorming format worked really well, or if using Slack for quick polls was helpful – so that our sprint process itself continuously improves week to week.

* **Collaborative Roles:** Not everyone will participate equally in every sprint, since different projects call for different expertise. Part of our methodology is being **cross-functional**: each sprint team will include a mix of technical staff, administrative coordinators, and academic specialists as needed. One person may act as a **sprint lead** (facilitator) for the week to coordinate meetings and keep the group on schedule. We’ll ask for volunteers to lead or co-lead each sprint during the planning phase. By rotating leadership and team composition, staff get to collaborate with different colleagues over the summer and develop new leadership skills in a low-stakes setting. Even those not actively working on a given week’s project will be invited to the end-of-week demo/review, so the knowledge disseminates across the whole Bok staff.

* **Sprinting Tools and Workspace:** We will take advantage of various tools to support sprint work. For instance, to coordinate tasks we might use a digital Kanban board (in Trello or Airtable) where team members post what they’re working on and update status. Communication will happen in a dedicated Slack channel for Summer 2025 Sprints, to keep discussions transparent. For documentation and outputs, we’ll use Google Drive (Docs/Sheets) so everyone can contribute and see progress in real time. If the sprint involves design or media creation, we have access to Adobe Creative Cloud, video equipment, and newer AI tools (e.g. using **ChatGPT for brainstorming or summarizing**, or an image generation tool for graphics) – part of the sprint ethos is to *try out* these tools. We’ve identified a host of technologies that staff are interested in learning, from advanced Google Suite features to programming with Python or using Harvard’s Canvas LMS. Sprint projects will be a vehicle for **skill-building** with such tools: for example, a sprint focusing on “learning systems” might involve a quick tutorial on how to pull data from Canvas or how to deploy a small web app, giving team members a chance to pick up that skill by doing it. By structuring work this way, each sprint doubles as a mini training workshop.

* **Thematic Frameworks:** To maximize coherence, we will frame each sprint with a **theme or problem area**. Some themes will be **operational/technical** (centered on improving our internal systems or outputs), and others will be **pedagogical** (centered on teaching and learning topics that inform our work). For instance, one sprint might revolve around **“Documentation & Reporting”** – in that week, whether a participant is an IT specialist or a pedagogy expert, they focus their efforts on how we document our activities and report outcomes. Another sprint might revolve around **“Storytelling”** – perhaps aimed at improving how we communicate our center’s impact, where one person might prototype a narrative annual report while another creates a short highlight video, both applying storytelling principles. We will choose themes that resonate across our different roles. Proposed thematic frameworks include: **Documentation**, **Storytelling**, **Civil Discourse**, **AI Literacy**, and **Systems Design**. Each of these is broad enough to encompass multiple projects and disciplines:

  * *Documentation* – Emphasizing capture of knowledge and processes. A history PhD on staff might draft a documentation guide for our programs (leveraging her research skills), while a tech staffer sets up an Airtable to log project metrics. Both efforts document our work, just in different forms.
  * *Storytelling* – Emphasizing narrative and presentation. One team member might focus on the “story” our data tells (turning raw numbers into an infographic or narrative report), while another collects success stories from faculty to include in our materials. Across domains, we practice framing our work as compelling stories.
  * *Civil Discourse* – Emphasizing inclusive communication and dialogue, which is a key teaching theme. In a sprint with this theme, a pedagogy specialist could develop a workshop module on facilitating difficult classroom conversations, while an admin staffer might draft new guidelines for respectful communication in our online forums. Each domain adapts the concept of civil discourse to its context.
  * *AI Literacy* – Emphasizing understanding and using artificial intelligence in education. Here a learning designer could create a simple **AI literacy primer for Teaching Fellows** (explaining how tools like ChatGPT can be used or misused in teaching), while a technical teammate experiments with AI-driven transcription of meeting notes to model how AI can augment our internal workflows. The theme ties together both the external (teaching) and internal (our own efficiency) dimensions of AI.
  * *Systems Design* – Emphasizing holistic thinking about our systems and how they interconnect. One person might map out the “learning journey” of a new Teaching Fellow (from onboarding to training to teaching) to identify gaps (a systems-thinking exercise in the training program), whereas another audits how our various databases and websites connect and proposes a better integration (a systems design exercise for our infrastructure). Both are applying systems design principles, just to different facets (people systems vs. technology systems).

  These frameworks ensure that **each sprint has a unifying vision**, even as individual contributions differ. They also encourage us to apply core values across everything we do. We anticipate drawing from our own identified strategic priorities – indeed, themes like AI literacy and civil discourse have already emerged as priorities for our team. By planning sprints around them, we make sure those important topics are not just discussed but actively built into our projects.

* **Reference Points and Examples:** We are not starting from zero in designing these sprints; we can draw on past experiences and external examples. Our own “Learning Lab” archives include previous summers’ project structures (e.g. the **2016 “maneuvers” project** and **2019 Summer syllabus**) which can inspire activities. Other institutions provide models too – as noted, UMD’s course design sprint and published guides on Teaching Sprints give us tested ideas on pacing and collaboration. We will adapt these models to fit our unique mix of tasks (from improving our website to preparing training sessions). Importantly, we’ll remain flexible: the sprint methodology is iterative, so we will refine the plan as we learn what works best for our team.

## **Proposed Implementation Plan: Summer 2025 Sprint Schedule**

Taking into account university calendars and our center’s goals, we propose the following structure for Summer 2025 sprint weeks. This plan sequences **one planning/orientation week**, **eight sprint weeks in June and July**, and then an **August phase for polishing and delivering our Teaching Fellow (TF) training**. Below is the timeline with proposed focus areas:

* **Planning Week – May 19–23, 2025:** *“Sprint Zero”* to align and prepare. This week is dedicated to setting the stage for all subsequent sprints. We will inventory our current systems and practices, surface pain points, and identify key projects. For example, one session will be a primer on our **reporting systems** – staff will review what data we currently collect for annual reports and where it resides. We might do a fun “scavenger hunt” activity where individuals try to find specific information (e.g. *“how many instructors did we support last year?”*) using our tools, to reveal gaps or inefficiencies in our information flow. Another session will be show-and-tell: colleagues like Laura, Shava, and Grace can demo our “Bok Central” Airtable bases and how they use them for reporting, while others (Dani, Blue) can show how they track Learning Lab projects, etc.. These knowledge-sharing demos get everyone up to speed on current practice. We’ll also introduce the sprint concept to the whole staff – possibly reading a short article or case study on sprint methodology to ground everyone in the rationale (homework could be a *“what is an annual report”* deep-read, connecting our content focus with the sprint approach). By week’s end, we will **brainstorm and finalize the list of sprint topics** for June/July, and create a big visible calendar (on the wall or a shared document) showing which theme is slated for which week. The planning week thus produces a roadmap for the summer. It also serves as a warm-up sprint itself: by engaging in collaborative exercises, the team gets a feel for the sprint style of working. *(Note: May 26–30 includes Memorial Day and Commencement; that week will be a lighter prep period or off time as people take leave after Planning Week.)*

* **Sprint Week 1 – June 2–6, 2025:** **Focus:** *Reporting & Documentation.* This week kicks off our project sprints by tackling how we collect, organize, and share information – a foundation for many other projects. The goal could be to prototype an improved **Annual Report workflow** for the Bok Center. Drawing on insights from Planning Week, the sprint team might decide to, for example, set up a new Airtable schema that consolidates data needed for annual reporting, and create a simple dashboard or template for generating the report. Throughout the week, as the team builds this system, they also generate documentation: e.g. a “user guide” for staff to input data properly, a timeline of reporting deadlines (integrated with Google Calendar), and an outline of the final report content. By Friday, the deliverable might be a rough **Reporting Toolkit** including the Airtable base, documentation, and a sample visualization of data. This sprint sets the tone by achieving a concrete result (better reporting system) and by emphasizing **documentation as a practice**. In doing so it touches on the “Documentation” thematic framework – reinforcing to everyone that producing knowledge assets (and not just keeping knowledge in our heads) is a priority. *(Possible additional outcomes: a “Pinterest-style” collection of exemplary reports from other organizations for inspiration, as suggested in brainstorming.)*

* **Sprint Week 2 – June 9–13, 2025:** **Focus:** *Onboarding & Forms (Interactive Onboarding).* After improving how we report out, we turn inward to how we bring people in. This week’s sprint addresses our **onboarding processes** for new staff, new Bok Graduate Fellows (BGFs), or other newcomers to our community. The sprint team might map out the current onboarding journey and identify pain points or gaps in engagement. A key idea from our planning notes is to make onboarding more interactive – for example, using Slack to create an onboarding chatbot or a scavenger hunt for new hires. The team could develop a Slack-based onboarding sequence where new members get guided messages, mini-quizzes, or automated tips over their first few weeks. Additionally, this sprint can tidy up all the *forms and data entry* points related to onboarding and program registration. For instance, we might streamline how graduate fellows register for training or how faculty request services, perhaps moving some Google Forms into Airtable or ensuring data flows into our systems without manual steps. By Friday, we aim to have a pilot **Onboarding Kit**, which might include: a draft interactive Slack onboarding channel with content ready, a set of updated forms that auto-populate our databases, and a checklist or handbook for supervisors to personalize the onboarding for each person. This sprint is **collaborative but disciplinary** in that HR/administrative staff provide expertise on onboarding content, technical staff handle the Slack bot scripting or form integrations, and teaching staff ensure the tone/content is welcoming and pedagogically sound. The process we follow (empathize with the new user, iterate on a welcome sequence, test it on ourselves) also introduces a *design thinking* mindset in a non-software context.

* **Sprint Week 3 – June 16–20, 2025:** **Focus:** *Media & Video Automation.* This week dives into creative media production – an area where we have emerging needs (e.g. creating teaching demonstration videos, capturing classroom moments) and new tools at our disposal. The sprint theme here connects with the **Storytelling** and **AI Literacy** frameworks: how can we leverage multimedia and AI to tell our teaching stories more effectively? The team might pursue something like developing a **“video automation pipeline.”** For example, they could test using AI tools to transcribe and caption videos of micro-teaching sessions, or experiment with software that auto-edits raw footage into short highlights. Another angle is improving our photography and video skills collectively – perhaps one afternoon is a hands-on workshop where everyone practices with our video cameras, and even generates some new headshots or team photos enhanced by AI (an idea noted in our set pieces list). By the end of the week, deliverables might include a few edited videos (e.g. a prototype promo video for the Bok Center or a sample recorded teaching demonstration), along with a documented workflow for how to go from raw footage to finished product efficiently. We might also produce a guide on **“augmented media production”** – tips on using AI tools (like image upscalers or caption generators) in our media work. This sprint’s outcome will not only be new media assets for the Center, but also improved **media-production capability** among staff (i.e. skill-building in video editing, audio, and use of creative apps). It captures the **creative but results-oriented** spirit: we get to play with cameras and editing software in novel ways, but towards a practical end of having reusable media content and processes. *(If time allows, the team could even take new staff headshots and refine them, yielding an updated staff directory with uniform, professional photos – a nice incidental win!)*

* **Sprint Week 4 – June 23–27, 2025:** **Focus:** *Learning Systems & Web Distribution.* In this sprint, the spotlight is on the various **systems and platforms** we use for teaching and learning content. The impetus here is that we have a lot of content (teaching resources, guides, lesson materials, website content) and multiple places they live (our Bok website, Canvas sites, Google Drive, etc.), and we want to make them more accessible and integrated. The sprint team could choose a project like creating a **“one-stop” web portal** for Bok Center resources. This might involve working with our Drupal-based Bok website to add a section that pulls in content dynamically (perhaps via an Airtable backend or a tagged repository). Alternatively, the team might prototype a **learning systems integration**: for instance, ensuring that when we conduct a training or event, the materials and recordings automatically get archived in a structured way that’s retrievable for future use. They could experiment with connecting Slack or Calendars to Canvas or building simple scripts (using Python/Google Colab) to sync data between systems. By Friday, a possible deliverable is a **“Bok Resource Hub”** – a proof-of-concept site or dashboard that aggregates our summer outputs (reports, videos, documents) in one easy-to-navigate interface for staff or perhaps for faculty we support. Internally, this sprint addresses the **Systems Design** theme: the team has to think systematically about how information flows through our center. Externally, it’s about better **communication/distribution** of our content to our audiences (faculty, TFs, etc.). The collaborative nature is again key: our web developer will bring technical know-how, our communications specialist ensures the branding and usability is on point, and our pedagogical experts select and organize content that is most valuable to share. This sprint wraps up the June series by delivering improved infrastructure that will support everything we do going forward. *(June 19 is Juneteenth holiday – sprint schedule will accommodate the shorter week)*

*(Week of June 30 – July 4: Summer break. No sprint this week; July 4 observed. Staff can take vacation or catch up as needed.)*

* **Sprint Week 5 – July 7–11, 2025:** **Focus:** *Pedagogical Theme 1 – “Teaching Touchstones & Documentation.”* Kicking off the July sprints, we shift more directly into pedagogical content development, leveraging the improved tools/systems from June. This week could center on collating the pedagogical research and **evidence base** that informs our programs. One idea is to create an **“intellectual toolkit”** for our teaching center – key ideas and references that staff and Teaching Fellows should know. For example, the sprint team might gather *touchstone* articles from scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL), cognitive science insights on learning, or even relevant pieces from the Chronicle of Higher Ed. They can then design a way to present this collection, perhaps an annotated bibliography in an Airtable or a visual gallery of key concepts. Simultaneously, they document the **contextual knowledge** (the “why”) behind our existing workshops and resources. By week’s end, we could have a draft of a **Bok Center Pedagogy Handbook** or resource library. This supports the **Documentation** framework in a scholarly sense – we are documenting the conceptual underpinnings of our practice. It’s also a form of storytelling: weaving disparate research and ideas into a narrative about our teaching philosophy. Each team member might take a sub-topic (e.g. inclusive teaching, active learning, Harvard-specific teaching policies) and curate content around it. The collaborative output makes our collective knowledge more visible and sharable. This sprint’s deliverable will be extremely useful as we prepare to train new Teaching Fellows, ensuring our training is grounded in well-documented evidence and exemplars.

* **Sprint Week 6 – July 14–18, 2025:** **Focus:** *Pedagogical Theme 2 – “Civil Discourse & Inclusive Teaching.”* Building on the previous week’s broad research, this sprint zooms into a specific teaching challenge that is highly relevant today: fostering civil discourse and inclusive participation in classrooms. The team this week might develop a **workshop or toolkit on civil discourse** for instructors. This can include activities, case studies, or guidelines for facilitating discussions on sensitive topics in diverse classrooms. For instance, they might create role-play scenarios (drawing on prior “immersive theater” techniques we’ve explored in microteaching) to let TFs practice handling difficult moments, or compile a set of community norms and conversation starters that promote respect and listening. At the same time, the sprint could produce something concrete for our own center’s use – perhaps a draft policy for inclusive facilitation in our events, or a training module we can deliver during August’s TF training. By Friday, we expect a **Civil Discourse Teaching Kit**, which might contain a facilitator’s guide, slides or handouts for a workshop, and references for further reading. This sprint exemplifies being *process-focused as much as product-focused*: the conversations among the team (likely engaging our diversity and inclusion specialists, experienced teaching consultants, and maybe graduate fellows) are as valuable as the materials produced. Those discussions will inform how we as a staff approach all our programming. Furthermore, the sprint format here ensures this complex topic gets dedicated attention and concrete strategies, rather than remaining a broad goal. It also demonstrates how a sprint can be **collaborative but disciplinary** – drawing on expertise from sociology, conflict resolution, and pedagogy to create something practical for instructors across disciplines.

* **Sprint Week 7 – July 21–25, 2025:** **Focus:** *Pedagogical Theme 3 – “AI Literacy in Teaching.”* By this week, AI tools and their impact on teaching will likely be a running thread (we’d have used AI in earlier sprints for our own productivity). Now we address it head-on for the educators we serve. The sprint team can develop resources to raise **AI literacy** among faculty and TFs. Possible products include: an **“AI in Teaching” guidebook** explaining emerging tools (like how to use large language models ethically for class prep, or how to teach students about AI), a set of example classroom activities that involve AI (for instance, having students critique an AI-generated essay as a critical thinking exercise), or even an interactive demo for August where TFs can try out an AI tool in a supervised setting. Since our staff has varying familiarity with AI, part of this sprint will be internal skill-building – perhaps a short tutorial on using OpenAI or Anthropic APIs for those interested, or discussions around the *pedagogical implications* of AI (academic integrity, accessibility, etc.). The deliverable might be a multi-faceted **AI Literacy Toolkit**: a written primer, plus some interactive elements (slides, or a simple web-based demonstration of an AI). By focusing the sprint here, we ensure the Bok Center stays ahead of the curve on a fast-moving topic and can confidently integrate AI discussions into August trainings. This sprint also ties back to some products from June – for example, if in Week 3 we built a workflow for video transcription using AI, we can now document that as a case study in how AI can augment teaching practice (capturing lectures, etc.). In doing so, we reinforce a culture of **AI augmentation** rather than replacement, aligning with our center’s values to use technology thoughtfully.

* **Sprint Week 8 – July 28 – August 1, 2025:** **Focus:** *Pedagogical Theme 4 – “Systems & Final Prep.”* This is the last pure sprint before we transition fully to August rehearsal mode. It’s a chance to tie up loose ends and ensure that everything we’ve built or planned is integrated for the start of term. The theme “systems” here is two-fold: (1) **Systems Thinking** – reviewing how all the pieces developed over summer fit together, and (2) final **System Integration** – making sure any remaining technical or content integration is done. The team this week might do a holistic run-through of a new Teaching Fellow’s experience (from the moment they receive onboarding in June, through attending our August training, to resources available during their teaching). As they walk through this “system,” they will use the tools and materials we’ve created: does the onboarding Slack bot work as intended? Is the documentation from Week 5 easily accessible when a TF needs it? Can the TF find our new videos or AI guide on the Resource Hub? This acts as a quality assurance sprint – any gaps found, we patch them. If something was not addressed in earlier sprints, we allocate time for a quick build or fix. For example, if we realize we never updated the **Bok website** with information about new services (or that the website needs a refresh), we dedicate a portion of the week to that (recalling the “Web-based distribution” idea). By week’s end, we produce a **Summer Synthesis Report** summarizing all sprint outputs and a checklist of what’s ready for August. Essentially, Sprint 8 ensures we have a cohesive “product” – the enhanced Bok Center offerings – emerging from the summer’s work. It also sets the stage for August by identifying what each training session will need. We can think of this week as the final **“tech rehearsal”** where all props and scripts are accounted for before the show starts. In fact, this resonates with a metaphor we’ve used: treating our summer work like a theatrical production leading up to an opening night. By the end of July, the set pieces are built and the actors (staff) know their parts; next, we rehearse.

* **August 2025 – Training Rehearsal and Delivery:** Unlike the earlier sprints, August is when we shift our focus to **delivering** the Teaching Fellow training and related programs, using what we developed. However, we will still apply a sprint-like mindset to how we prepare each week of August:

  * **Week 9 (Aug 4–8)** will be a *“Dress Rehearsal”* for the August workshops. We’ll use this week to run through the planned TF training sessions internally. Each workshop leader can present or simulate their session for the rest of the staff (the “internal audience”) to gather feedback. This is essentially our last sprint’s review stage, where the product is our training content and the review is peer feedback. Any final tweaks or improvements to slides, activities, or timing can be made here (better to discover issues now than in front of students). We can also test all logistics (Does the A/V equipment work? Are handouts printed? If using Zoom or Canvas for parts, are they set up correctly?). By the end of the week, we should feel confident that the training is polished and ready.
  * **Week 10 (Aug 11–15)** might serve as an *“Off-Broadway Preview.”* In theater terms, this is like performing the show in a smaller venue to an audience to see how it lands before the big premiere. We can parallel this by doing an internal Fellows’ training or pilot sessions. For instance, if we have Bok Graduate Fellows (BGFs) or a select group of experienced TAs available, we could run parts of the training for them as both a practice and a way to on-board them (some institutions do a “train the trainer” approach). Alternatively, we might collaborate with another unit (perhaps the Office of Undergraduate Education or a friendly department) to deliver a subset of our workshops to a sample audience. The idea is to get a **real-world trial** of our training content in a low-stakes environment. Feedback from this week will be noted for last-minute adjustments.
  * **Week 11 (Aug 18–22)** is the *prelude to Opening Night*. Many of our new Teaching Fellows arrive and we might begin certain orientation activities. We can treat this as part of the launch: ensure all materials from the summer (videos, guides, etc.) are accessible to the new TFs, perhaps even assign some as pre-work. It’s also when any **University-wide training integration** happens (for example, if we coordinate with the Graduate School’s orientation or a **New Faculty Institute (NFI)** rehearsal, as mentioned in our notes, we’ll slot in our contributions). Our team will be on deck to facilitate sessions, utilizing the confidence and content built over the summer.
  * **Week 12 (Aug 25–29)** is *“Opening Night”*: the main **Teaching Fellow Training week** at the start of the Fall semester. All the planning and sprint work culminates here. We deliver the workshops, orientation sessions, and materials that we have refined. Because of our summer sprints, we expect this delivery to be particularly strong – we will be using the slide decks, activities, and examples that were carefully crafted and tested, rather than rushed together last-minute. In addition, thanks to the sprint approach, our staff will have deeper knowledge of the content and systems (everyone has had some exposure to the various topics, whether through participating in a sprint or attending the show-and-tells). This should make the execution smoother and more confidence-inspiring for the team.

After the TF training, we will, of course, debrief as a staff (in early September) to capture lessons from both the summer sprint experiment and the training itself. The expectation is that the sprint framework will have helped us meet our key deliverables – such as a completed Annual Report, a functional onboarding system, new training curricula, updated websites, and enriched skill sets – all within the summer timeline, without the process feeling chaotic or overwhelming. Instead, it will have felt *energizing* and *purposeful*. Each week had a focus, the team had fun collaborating in new ways, and crucially, we kept both process and product in sight throughout.

## **Conclusion and Next Steps**

This planning document has outlined the **why** and **how** of sprinting through the Bok Center’s summer 2025 work. By drawing on agile and design thinking principles, and tailoring them to our teaching and learning mission, we aim to create a summer experience that is productive, creative, and developmental for our staff. The proposed schedule and themes are a starting framework. The next step will be to discuss this plan with the entire team (during the May 19–23 Planning Week kickoff) to refine the sprint topics and assign roles. We should remain open to adjusting as we go – agility is, after all, about responding to change and feedback.

By the end of the summer, if we execute these sprints well, we should see not only a suite of **tangible outputs** (better systems, polished training materials, documented resources), but also **growth in our team**. Ideally, staff will report that they learned new skills (technical and pedagogical), gained a fuller picture of the Center’s operations, and felt more connected through collaborating in sprint teams. These outcomes align with our dual focus on process and product.

In summary, the sprint approach offers a **structured, yet flexible framework** to channel our summer energies. It ensures alignment with our strategic priorities (through chosen themes like reporting, onboarding, media, learning systems, documentation, storytelling, civil discourse, AI, and systems design) and provides a cadence to accomplish a great deal in a short time. As other educational organizations have discovered, short iterative cycles can drive meaningful innovation. With careful planning and enthusiastic participation, Summer 2025 can become a model of how academic centers might adopt “sprint weeks” to propel their mission forward – **collaboratively, creatively, and efficiently**.
