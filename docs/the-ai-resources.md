# The AI Resources

Welcome to the AI Resource Book! This repository powers a website dedicated to curating, organizing, and sharing high-quality resources related to artificial intelligence for faculty and students at Harvard and other colleges and universities.

The goal of this project is to provide:
- **Guides and Tutorials:** Clear, accessible introductions to AI concepts, tools, and best practices for academic use.
- **Teaching Materials:** Syllabi, assignments, and classroom resources for educators integrating AI into their courses.
- **Research Tools:** Links to datasets, software, and platforms useful for AI research and experimentation.
- **Ethics and Policy:** Information on responsible AI use, academic integrity, and the societal impact of AI.
- **Community Updates:** Blog posts, news, and events relevant to the academic AI community.

This site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to make it easy to contribute, update, and navigate. Whether you're a faculty member designing a new course, a student exploring AI for the first time, or anyone interested in the intersection of AI and higher education, you'll find valuable resources here.
